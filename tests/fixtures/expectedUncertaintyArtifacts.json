  "The enemy dragon craft soldiers have only one mind, a foolish delusion, and they want to crush anyone who stands in their way.　So. I'm not sure if I can resist it by using any tricks to catch it or handle it.",
  "Immediately after that, Tsukiyama appeared.　And the person in question did not notice it right away.　It's ...... strange.　If the roar of the crowd startled you into releasing the jutsu - Fuuma's chieftain was startled by the sound? --I'm not sure what to do.　If you're not startled, there's no reason for you to release the jutsu.",
  "\"...... I see.　I'm not sure what to make of it.",

  "In the event that you are not able to find out the existence of the enemy, it is not acceptable for ...... Muramasa to admit that he, who is there to defeat Silver Star, is not even able to determine the existence of the enemy.　It's no use getting bogged down in mentalism.",
  "It's a ...... pre-war craft body.　You can't get it out for sure. If you want to get a laugh out of your customers, you can. In the event that you have any questions regarding where by and how to use it, you can call us at the web site.",
  "But I'm not sure if my physical capabilities are up to the task of racing.　I'll have to see if my body is up to the task.",

  "The ...... gunstock struck the man's forehead with a very heavy, dull thud.　There was no way there would be a puddle. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to do it.",
  "...... Twelve laps to go.　Eight laps to go.　I had to pit in exactly halfway through my tenth lap.　......The auxiliary propulsion unit for the racer cruiser on my back is just for decoration. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.",
  "I already know that Muramasa is terribly stubborn and obstinate in those areas.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. ...... Even if you didn't know, the preceding act is enough to get you started.",

  "He struck Sorimachi's sword and slashed it down to his shoulder.　It was a shallow slash, but he made sure the blade reached him.　The craft's performance was different by nature. He had superior muscle power and altitude advantage.　I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.",
  "He threw away the voice that sounded like a warning, carried the sword on his right shoulder, and took it back to the upper step.　On the other hand, the enemy's shadow was in a lower position.　--The enemy shadow, on the other hand, has a lowered stance.　I will take the lower position and he will take the upper position, so there is no competition.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　---- Itto-ryu, the inner workings of which are one of \"Kirikiri\".",
  "Itto-ryu \"Kiri-rachi\" is a technique in which an enemy's blow is met with a completely symmetrical blow that cuts it off and also cuts off the enemy's body.　In the event that both sides strike each other with equal intentions, the side with the greater power and precision will win.　I had the upper hand in this fight.　The wounds I inflicted were not light.　This must have changed the course of events!　The next round will decide it.　　...... That's it with this guy.　I'm not going to kill you, but I'm going to beat you so bad you can't move, and then I'm going to face the monster.　I'm not sure what to do.

  "The sorimachi that had struck and crossed each other were still running up into the sky - and continuing to rise.　 If I were to follow the conventions of craft warfare, I would have to circle the helm angle and move into a descent to gain speed for the next round.　Are they trying to escape?　No - even if you're leaving the battle area, it's standard procedure to gain speed downward.　If so, it's an odd move to gain altitude advantage.　There's no point in taking the upper hand in this way. It would take too much time. By the time you have gained altitude, turned around, and are ready to charge, you will be faced with an enemy who has done it all.　...... or.　It's a good thing that you're not the only one who can do this.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.　--I'm sure there is. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.",
  "And yet, it still rises.　In addition, the angle of the helmet is raised further.　It's not that I don't like it.　Endlessly. Endlessly. Insatiable.　To the zenith.　Aiming for the white circle palace that can never be reached.　 What does Sorimachi think?　Is it just a lack of resignation that keeps him from changing course even though he is being tracked?　Our speed is decreasing rapidly.　I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what you need to do.",

  "Dead air flies.　I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I think it's a good idea.　I'm not sure if you've heard of it, but I have.　...... dead?　The word \"dead\" passed through my mind.　It's not because I thought so.",
  "He meditates with one eye behind his helmet and throws the last word to me.　It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.",
  "Perhaps emboldened even more by his rage, the monster lumbered after the enemy, who could not even catch up with him. I'm not sure what to do.　I'm not sure what to make of that. It's a great way to make sure you don't get caught in the middle of the action.",

  "The flash, like a ...... thunderbolt.　I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to try.",
  "I'm not sure if the consciousnesses of both of them, which seem to be attracted to each other and finally merge, heard it.　A pleasure killer and a taste for murder, tsurugi* - the consciousnesses of both of them, attracted to each other and finally fused, may or may not have heard it.　Protected by the finest armor, they have yet to strike a fatal blow. However, their fighting power must have been almost exhausted.　One more blow, and the enemy craft - the sixth parasite - would cease its activities.　This time, too, it was a close call, but we were barely able to prevent the \"eggs\" from hatching.",
  "It is unbelievable and shameful.　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure it's a good idea. ......",
