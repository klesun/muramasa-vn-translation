  "\"It's a meticulous attention to detail.　That's Ayane-sama.",
  "Well, there's something weird about them.",
  "The ability to use others for your own benefit. This is an absolutely necessary power.　As long as the competition isn't one-on-one.",
  "\"Ethics,\" ......, and a \"society\" built on ethics.",
  "But there was no other truth that could be analogized from the scene in front of him.",
  "With that, Ichijou turned on his heel.　He walked toward the gate.",
  "\"Yes.　Still, taking is evil, and if you are unaware of the evil, it is shameless.",
  "Finally, one line of the story was connected.　But there is one more line.",
  "\"It is the duty of our servants to protect and serve Your Highness.",
  "It's time.　Clench your teeth, midou!",
  "\"I understand you had a relationship with Kageaki-kun and the others at Fudaraku?",
  "It's not only the privilege of wicked people to gather in groups.",
  "Ichijou looked up at me.　I looked into his eyes, too.",
  "What is it that kills and destroys them?　What is it that destroys a crowd of people, quite apart from war?",
  "If he stays with me, he won't have to kill the right people anymore. ......",
  "How many days will it be before the whole of Yamato is swallowed up?　It will be many days before even the ends of the world are swallowed up.",
  "...... until I take down Silver Star.　I have to go the way of the killer.",
  "\"And yet, my hands are not rough at all. They are white, clean, and smooth.　Instead, there are light bruises at the base of my fingers.",
  "Rapid start. Exhaust.　The entire body of the armor shivered at the forceful securing of thrust.",
  "\"It's only been six months.　Despite that, you're the calmest person I know and you got the situation right. ......",
  "I pulled the girl's tongue, which I had caught, into my mouth.　I bit her sweetly, blocking her movement.",
  "Silvery skin, almost like platinum.　The shape of the human body seems to have been abstracted to the extreme.",
  "If it's just cutting down those people, but...　It's not good that your actions are almost becoming a rumor in the world. ......",
  "Bracing himself with a luxurious tsurugi*, the officer steps forward.　He does not seem to be giving orders to his men.",
  "As I recall, there are some national treasures inside .......　It would be best to be as careful as possible so as not to harm the building.",
  "What is tsurugi*? It is an armor made of layers of human flesh and metal, and it has the characteristics of both a living organism and a metallic object. In other words, tsurugi* has human-like intelligence, can regenerate damage like a living organism, and is capable of operating on its own. The object is undoubtedly metal, and will not move unless used by others, and will not die, decay, or otherwise change if placed in an appropriate storage environment.　And. Needless to say, it gives the power of a demon god to the warrior who wears it. That is tsurugi*.",

  "It's just a formality, isn't it?　A course of assassination/abduction of a dignitary under the guise of a training flight would be child's play.",
  "But my feet slipped endlessly.　The soles of my feet were burning as hot as a barbecue griddle.",
  "\"It is said that the noblewoman was terribly afraid of losing her beauty through the ruthless aging process.　The blacksmith, Durko, could not bear to see it happen.",
  "\"Stripped of its life force, it belongs to the trader.　As a result, well, this is what happens.",
  "But he did not.　All he gave his father was a blade of determination.",
  "If pain is an ebb and flow, pleasure is a surge.　It enters through my manhood and sweeps over my every nerve in the blink of an eye.",
  "If you cannot dispel the arrows, your defeat will be decided there.　　How do we accomplish this?",
  "Why I can't stop her.　Why she doesn't care about me.",
  "\"My fiancé and I are ...... the complete opposite.",
  "I couldn't speak up anymore, though.",
  "He bent down as if he were drooping.　 Ootori Shishiku--",
  "...... Ootori Kanae did not hold a grudge against her father for abandoning her.　Rather, it was quite the opposite.",
  "《...... I'm no longer your ...... tsurugi.》",
  "\"Muramasa. ...... Oh, you will.",
  "If you kill your enemy, you will also kill your friend.",
  "If they are useless, they should be cut down.　Get out of the way.",
  "\"Don't worry. It's only for a moment.　It is not the intention of the Light to interfere with your mind in this way.",
  "\"I can't believe you can't kill your own family.",
  "\"Therefore the world will break.",
  "\"...... Mmm.　If you say so, I have nothing to say to you.",
  "\"Candy and whips, huh?　Classic.",
  "\"Not at all.　You've even saved my life. ......",
  "\"Hmm, hmm, hmm.　I was expecting you to arrive at dawn, but you're taking your time. ......?",
  "\"Yes, sir.　 Captain Ootori Kanae and Nagakura Sayo.",
  "\"I will give you the opportunity to kill the princess.",
  "The fact that I said it out loud settled it.",
  "The Shogunate has been lobbying the Imperial Court to declare Ashikaga Kuniuji as a daishogunate. .......　When this succeeds, the situation in Yamato will probably reach a critical juncture.",
  "\"And, of course, the identification of the agents should be carried out secretly and quickly.",
  "Kageaki's adoptive father gritted his teeth audibly.　With a serious sense of defeat in his eyes, he desperately fought against the despair coming his way.",
  "It's so easy to erase all thoughts and throw your whole body and soul into one sword!　By such an easy process, the magic sword will be realized!",
  "The League of Nations Occupation Forces in Yamato - in reality, the British Commonwealth Forces.　In other words, the world's strongest and most advanced military force.",
  "Me and Chachamaru will watch over the end.",
  "Ashikaga Chachamaru said, giving the light a chance to kill.",
  "You've at least comforted yourself, haven't you?",
  "If that is the case, the signal to start the war will come when Kuniuji-dono-subordinate becomes a general and the Shogunate regime is in a position to rebuild.",
  "He was the only one who didn't know anything about Silver Star, and he looked quite confused when he heard what I had to say.　He was silent in his mask and seemed to be digesting the information.",
  "I'm here to check on Furukawa's situation.",
  "It was a military vehicle.　It was a roofless type, with two exotic soldiers in it.",
  "Yes, that's ....... Someone wants to see Major General Mizuhi immediately.",
  "If we keep our minds steadfast, we should be able to ward off this interference!",
  "...... What are the intentions?",
  "Think of all the stupid things you can do at ......!",
  "I ran through the air, trying to shake off something that was entangling me.",
  "Isn't it possible that that thing can be used for defense as well?",
  "《......, but the facts don't say so.》",
  "Fortunately, nothing troublesome seems to be happening, so we'll just keep quiet and--",
  "It can be a dog or a cat.　Or a frog or an ant.",
  "The river is not very wide, but it seems to be deep.　I stood there and checked the facts.",
  "...... Is it really that difficult?",
  "There was only one path to choose from.",
  "...... But that's it.　He didn't seem to shake it off or push it away.",
  "If you'd only been more diligent!",
  "I don't like the way you look at me.",

  "The second was the Koga-ryoshu.　 They were stationed at Fudaraku Castle with some of the Kogakubo Prefecture's soldiers. The command was naturally given by Kogakubo Yusa Doushin or his deputy.",
  "Fourth, the Horikoshi Lords.　This force is dispatched by the Horikoshi government, and is commanded by Chachamaru. Reflecting Horikoshi's wealthy finances, they excel in logistics, and are often battered by other troops - not that it matters now.",
  "The fifth was the Shinogawa Lords.　 Under the command of Ootori Shishiku, they are the generals who have split off from the Aizu Shinogawa Legion, which is said to be the most elite of the Rokugara, and are packed into Fudaraku."
