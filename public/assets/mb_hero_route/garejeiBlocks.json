They would’ve done this by dropping a bomb on Fudaraku Castle, eliminating the Rokuhara in one swift move. In Kanae’s route, they do actually accomplish this, and the entire castle blows sky high. However, this time, due to Kageaki and Ichijou’s infiltration into Fudaraku and the losses suffered by the Rokuhara, they can hardly act as saviors anymore and look good at the same time: after all, no one would accept the GHQ as “legitimate” conquerors if they basically came in and defeated a Shogunate that was already on the brink of collapse anyway."

I didn’t point it out then because at that time I haven’t read Chapter 5 yet and didn’t really know what Hikaru looked like. Her desire to see the world end would coincide with the Ginseigou’s wish to spread death and destruction, so there’s that too.

Long story short, he came across an incident that led him to realize the fundamental contradiction in his ways. Basically, one of his friends did something that had both a good and a bad outcome. He wanted to help out a an empoverished village, but was using illegal means to do so, or something like this. Sorry, this part might not be super accurate because I was reading it late at night and only skimmed through it due to being really tired, but as far as I remember he basically reported his friend (because that’s the right thing to do, aka justice) and then saved the village using his own money. However, no one knew it was him who helped the village. His friend even accused him of being a traitor or something like that.
