<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Full Metal Daemon Muramasa</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Hero</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This project is a fairly old work of mine, written and translated back in 2012, when I was still just starting out as a fan translator — as such, it’s not exactly the highest quality work I’ve ever put out, to say the least. I would’ve deleted it long ago, but since people still seem to be interested in it, I decided to keep it, but felt the need to give this quick warning beforehand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-1062"></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“This is not a story of heroes.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“And yet… a lone hero shall rise.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">IMPORTANT: This is a continuation of the story right after the end of Chapter 5. You can only read this if you’ve already read the first five “common” chapters.</p>
<p>(Before you read this, it is important that you also read my summary of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-chapter-3-4-ichijou-differences/">Chapter 3-4 differences</a> that happen if you choose to pursue Ichijou’s route.)</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s begin.</p>
<p>We start with a rather lengthy backstory about how Masamune came to be – how Yamato was invaded, their women raped and then killed, and so on. The people of Yamato, shaken up by this, sought out an old blacksmith in order to create a Tsurugi specialized in smiting evil.</p>
<p>Aferwards, we cut to Ichijou and Sorimachi on the streets of Kamakura.</p>
<p>Ichijou: You’re lying! Do you expect me to believe that Minato would murder innocents in cold blood?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917" title="hero1" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero1.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Sorimachi: Well then… why don’t you ask him yourself? I’m sure he wouldn’t lie to you.</p>
<p>Ichijou: ………</p>
<p>Sorimachi does his usual insane cackle, and we fade to black.</p>
<p>We get the same newspaper article informing us about the demise of Ashikaga Moriuji. Kageaki is sitting home, reading the paper and wondering who the killer was (because, much like in Kanae’s route, he refused to do the job himself)</p>
<p>We then cut to Chief and the prince, who discuss the issue of the Rokuhara and Moriuji’s death, and lament the fact Kageaki is too focused on the Ginseigou to help them. Chief, however, suddenly coems up with an idea and says that there might be one more person (another Musha) capable of helping them. I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE. (It’s pretty obvious.)</p>
<p>We then cut to the Rokuhara HQ, where Chachamaru and Raichou are trying to come up with a new name for the Rokuhara now that Morijui is dead.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero4.jpg"><img title="hero4" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero4.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Raichou: But first, we’ll have to arrange a grandiose funeral for him!</p>
<p>Shishiku: Hmpf. We have better things to do than that.</p>
<p>Raichou: Better things to do…? It’s his funeral!</p>
<p>Sh: So what? It’s only a matter of burning and burying the body. That’s all.</p>
<p>R: H-how dare you talk like that about someone you’ve sworn allegiance to!</p>
<p>Sh: I served him while he was alive. His rotting corpse is of no interest to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1074" title="hero5" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero5.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>So things heat up and Rachiou is about to duel it out with Shishiku, but Doushin calms them down and tells him that they first need to take care of Kuniuji’s succession and rebuild/strengthen the Rokuhara (or at least give that impression) so that their enemies, the GHQ and those wanting to overthrow the Shogunate, cannot use this as an opportunity to attack. Raichou gets a lowly position in Kantou, and they then talk about who gets the duty of protecting Kunijui, and they end up choosing Doushin. Raichou excuses himself, and we briefly see that he is unhappy with this state of affairs.</p>
<p>Back with Kageaki at home, doing… well, not much, while Muramasa is out there searching for traces of Ginseigou.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1085" title="hero6" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero6.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>I keep on killing and killing and killing. Who will be next? There remains one more egg-receiver. That person will be the enemy I shall destroy. As for the ally I will also have to slay… I have no doubts it will be *her*.</em></p>
<p><em>She, with her goodness and pure heart longing for justice. It has to be her.</em></p>
<p><em>I envy and admire her at the same time. The more I see her, the stronger those feelings become. If given the chance, I would wish to become like her. True and just. Never straying from that path.</em></p>
<p><em>However, such a thing is beyond the grasp of a man such as I.</em></p>
<p><em>The next time I fell an enemy, she, too, will die.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Ichijou herself appears before him. SHe simply stares at him silently with a stern facial expression.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107" title="hero8" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero8.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>Today, she was different. She was the Ichijou from back when we first met – the girl who felt nothing but contempt for me. It wasn’t the cold weather that sent a chill through my entire body. Was I experiencing a sudden feeling of dread? Dread of… what, exactly?</em></p>
<p><em>She thrust out her hand with a piece of paper in it.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato…</p>
<p><em>I was at my wit’s end, too overwhelmed to be able to say anything.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it hatred? Anger? Sorrow?</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Will you…</p>
<p><em>The girl standing before me was akin to a beautiful sword. A blade forged to perfection with a fiery passion. Steel that exists only to end a life.</em></p>
<p><em>A certain someone’s life.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1118" title="hero9" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero9.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Will you go see a movie with me?<br>
(WHAT.)</p>
<p>So they go see a movie and have lunch afterwards at some restaurant (complete with the stereotypical cute waitress, see picture. I am slightly distracted by the fact that she’s voiced by the same voice actress who did Mizuhi’s role in Chapter 5, which is a complete coincidence, but still).</p>
<p>Ichijou orders tanuki (some special kind of Japanese racoon).</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918" title="hero10" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero10.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: A splendid choice.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Really?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I was quite shocked by its exquisite taste the first time I tried it. It was 10 years ago – me and a few classmates were celebrating our graduation and decided to check out a local restaurant. In other words, this place. All of them brought quite a large amount of money, expect for me. I only had a few hundred yen in my wallet.</p>
<p>Ichijou: (Why is he telling me this…?)</p>
<p>Kageaki: As a challenge, in order to mock me, they began ordering some of the most expensive meals on the menu. However, I managed to turn the situation around quite unexpectedly. This became clear the moment the cheap 60-yen tanuki I ordered was finally delivered to my table. As we were leaving, my classmates admitted that I, who spent the least amount of money, ended up having the most delicious meal. It was a complete victory for me.</p>
<p>They talk a bit about the rations policy of the Rokuhara and that it had both good and bad consequences, and the conversation then takes a turn towards… well, something else:</p>
<p>Ichijou: Even if someone does something that is considered good, his past sins are not erased. Good is good, evil is evil. If there is someone out there who, on the surface, is fighting against the forces of evil, but in reality is a villain himself… I don’t think I could ever forgive such a person.</p>
<p>(Yup, this mirrors Kanae’s scene rather well. The way Ichijou said that is no coincidence.)</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou…</p>
<p>Ichijou: Let’s leave. I’d like you to accompany me to one more place.</p>
<p>So she takes her to Ennouji temple.</p>
<p>K: Ennouji…?</p>
<p>I: My father would often take me here when I was younger. He told me this shrine was erected for a god that judges evil.</p>
<p>K: He must have been a noble person. I wish I could have met him.</p>
<p>I: Thank you.</p>
<p>I: However… I can’t stand this temple. Every time father brought me here, he put on a serious expression – like he was being tormented by something. There was never anything enjoyable about our visits to this place.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929" title="hero11" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero11.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>I: I finally realized why he visited this place time and again. He came here to strengthen his resolve – to prepare himself for the heavy burden of fighting against evil.</p>
<p>I: I now feel the same way he did. Because… this place has now gained a similar signifiance for me as well.</p>
<p><em>She turned around and looked at me in silence.</em></p>
<p>I: Minato…</p>
<p>K: Ichijou.</p>
<p>I: I… I know it has to be a lie. A false accusation, nothing more. I know you’re someone I can trust!</p>
<p>K: ………</p>
<p>I: B-but… I must know. I have to confirm something so I can rest easy knowing it was just a lie!</p>
<p>K: Ichijou…</p>
<p>I: Please, answer me! I beg of you – tell me it’s not true! You wouldn’t murder innocent people in cold blood!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero12.jpg"><img title="hero12" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero12.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>K: W-who… told you that?</p>
<p>I: It was Sorimachi. He told me… that while fighting against the Rokuhara and the Ginseigou… you also murdered innocent people who’ve done you no harm. I-it’s… it’s not true, is it?! It cannot be!</p>
<p><em>She trusted me. For that very reason, she is now on the verge of despair – shivering in fear of the possibility that everything she believed in might come crumbling down.</em></p>
<p>I: Please… tell me it’s not true…</p>
<p>Her voice is trembling at this point.</p>
<p>I: Come on… hurry up and tell me how wrong I am…</p>
<p>Bloody images of all of Kageaki’s previous victims, from Subaru to Yuuhi, flash into his mind.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not true.” “It’s a lie.” – That is all it would take. If I said that… if I could bring myself to say that…</em></p>
<p>Long silence.</p>
<p>I: W-why… aren’t you saying anything…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I…</p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato…!</p>
<p><em>“…am innocent” Come on. Say it. That one sentence. Say it, and this girl’s trust in you will not crumble to dust. The two of you could continue what you had been doing up until now as if nothing happened.</em></p>
<p><em>Say it.</em></p>
<p>K: …am a murderer. Sorimachi told you the truth. I massacre both good and evil without distinction.</p>
<p>She breaks down in tears.</p>
<p>I: Nnnooooooooooo…!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962" title="hero14" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero14.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>A scream louder than a thunderstorm, roaring with such power that could reach up to the heavens. The cry of the betrayed.</em></p>
<p>K: Do you recall Nitta Yuuhi? He was the boy you saved from the yakuza that day. I was the one who murdered him.</p>
<p>K: And the small village where we met for a second time? I was the one who killed the two daughters of the elderly Emishi man living in that area.</p>
<p>K: No doubt you remember Captain Ootori Kanae as well, who has gone missing recently. That is because… I murdered her.</p>
<p><em>What I have just told her so plainly was the undeniable truth. The very truth she desired so much.</em></p>
<p>I: W-why…?</p>
<p>K: You want a reason? I have none.</p>
<p><em>There was nothing I could say that would wash my sins away.</em></p>
<p>K: If you really want a reason, let me say this: I did it because… that’s just the way I am.</p>
<p>(He’s basically echoing Muramasa’s words from the end of Chapter 5.)</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>……..<br>
I: Unforgivable. I remember it now… you said so yourself. You told me you were not a hero, but a simple murderer. And I… I fell for it. I misunderstood you. I believed in you. I admired you!</p>
<p>She breaks into a borderline-psychotic laughter.</p>
<p>I: Minato Kageaki. I will never forgive you. You will die by my hands.</p>
<p>K: And how do you plan to do that?</p>
<p>I: With this! Masamune!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983" title="hero16" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero16.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>K: Masamune?!</p>
<p>Masamune: ‘Tis not a name that a villain has any right to utter!</p>
<p>Masamune: Not a single trace of evil shall remain in this world while I exist!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Indeed. Evil shall perish before us – and the wicked shall pay the price.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Why do you have that Tsurugi? When-</p>
<p>Ichijou: It matters not.</p>
<p><em>The coldness and animosity that littered her tone rivaled her Tsurugi’s.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I will end you, “Muramasa”.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Ichijou: Tomorrow. In the forest behind this shrine. And bring your Tsurugi as well.<br>
….<br>
Ichijou: Mark my words – you shall fall by my hands.</p>
<p>And then she leaves.</p>
<p><em>Since Tsurugi and Master feel the same, see the same and hear the same, she experienced the conversation just now the same way Kageaki did.</em><br>
Muramasa: ………</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou…<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994" title="hero17" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero17.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>As legend tells it, Masamune and Muramasa were training under the same master as blacksmiths.</em></p>
<p><em>Muramasa viewed Tsurugi as tools only used for murder and destruction, while Masamune was of gentler heart, believing in the true and just way of the sword. One day, their master called them out to the riverbank, and ordered them to lower the blades they forged into the water, while they would observe the fallen leaves that were drifting downstream. As Muramasa did so, the blade cut everything in its path – not a single leaf in the water was left untouched. Masamune’s blade was different – as if affected by magic, all the leaves changed direction and avoided the sword – not a single one of them was cut. Watching in silence for a while, their master finally began to speak:</em></p>
<p><em>“Muramasa’s blade is one that cuts everything in its path without distinction, even simple and innocent things such as the leaves of a tree – it does not compare to the grace of Masamune’s sword. For the blade is a tool that should only cut that needs to be cut, and leave everything else untouched.”</em></p>
<p><em>And thus, Masamune came to be known as the finest Tsurugi of the land, while Muramasa was feared and loathed as a bloodthirsty, cursed being.</em></p>
<p><em>However, the above is merely a legend conjured up by men of later generations. In reality, Masamune and Muramasa did not have the same master – in fact, they did not even live in the same time period.</em></p>
<p>We get a brief scene with Ichijou walking around the town at night, thinking of Kageaki, and how he made her realize what it means to fight against evil. It means taking up arms even if the prospects of victory are slim – if there exists something in this world that is unforgivable, no matter how great of an evil it is, one must oppose it. Much like Kageaki is determined to fight against the Ginseigou at all costs, she, too, wil fight the evil known as Muramasa.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1016" title="hero19" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero19.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>One single word kept circling around in her mind. She kept coming back to it over and over again, unable to let go.</em></p>
<p>“Why…?”</p>
<p><em>She wished she could forget it all and make a fresh start. However, for her, that was impossible.</em></p>
<p>“I am the daughter of Ayane Ichidou.”</p>
<p><em>She was the daughter of that man – and knowing what that fact meant, she realized that she had no way of escaping her fate – her duty to oppose evil. Minato Kageaki. The very man who had shown her the way towards her true calling.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato…</p>
<p>Then Chief shows up.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028" title="hero20" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero20.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Chief: Ayane Ichijou. My name is Kikuchi, from the Kamakura Police Department. I’d like to have a few words with you.</p>
<p>I: Perfect timing. I was thinking the same.</p>
<p>End of scene.</p>
<p>Back to Kagaeki the next day.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou… you know very well what we must do. Remember that we are on a mission. Any obstructions, no matter who or what they are, must be eliminated.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I know…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1038" title="hero21" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero21.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>I was the only one who could oppose the nightmare that was the Ginseigou. There was no one else fit for that task. She was my sister, after all. And… it was the dying wish of my foster mother.</em></p>
<p><em>In other words… I have to press on. No matter who or what I trample underfoot, I will need to go on. Just like I have done up to now.</em></p>
<p>So he goes to the metting place in the forest, and meets Ichijou there, already in her Musha form.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" title="hero22" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero22.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Masamune: Muramasa. During these past 700 years, I’ve heard much about you. The bloodthirsty Tsurugi, leaving nothing but bloodhsed and chaos in her wake. The heavy scent of blood you carry is a testament to the truth of those rumors.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Masamune. The beauty and grace of your armor is truly unmatched – not a single drop of blood taints its brilliance. However, you spent the past 700 years sealed away and lying dormant in a treasury, existing as a simple onlooker bearing no responsibilites!</p>
<p>Masamune: You know nothing of the pain of having a sacred mission and not being able to do anything about it. The likes of you wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Muramasa: You’re right, I don’t. The same way you know nothing of how much I, and everyone else living in that age, has suffered!</p>
<p>Masamune: Silence that wicked tongue of yours! Midou! To battle!</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou! Don your armor!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato Kageaki. Murderer. Cursed daemon. I… will kill you.</p>
<p>Kageaki: …….</p>
<p>Ichijou: You doubt me? You think I can’t do it?</p>
<p>Kageaki: No. If anyone can do this, it’s you. You possess the power and the unshakable conviction that can judge evil.</p>
<p>Ichijou: So what are you standing there for? Are you planning to get yourself killed just like that?</p>
<p>Kageaki: No. I cannot allow myself to die just yet.</p>
<p>He raises his hand and utters the words of his dark contract.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" title="hero23" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero23.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Meet a demon – slay the demon. Meet a saint – slay the saint. Therein lies the way of the sword.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa. To battle.</p>
<p>The fight for a bit, and Masamune uses his arm cannon to blow Kageaki away – for some reason, Ichijou is screaming in pain while she does so. They soon figure out that the cannon is using Ichijou’s own flesh and blood as ammunition. No wonder she was screaming like that.</p>

<p>Kagaeki prepares his usual lightning blade attack, but due to being conflicted by lingering feelings for Ichijou, he ends up missing. In response, Masamune does his attack as well and crushes Kageaki.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero29.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1049" title="hero29" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero29.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Masamune: The wicked pay the price! Justice prevails! That is the one and true way of the world.</p>
<p><em>The man before me is a murderer. A sinner. He shed the blood of innocents who did not deserve death. No matter what reason he had for it, I’ll have to be the one punish him. That is the way of justice that he taught me…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053" title="hero32" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero32.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>“You think I can’t do it?”</p>
<p><em>Hurry up and end it.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Why…</p>
<p><em>All I have to do is thrust my blade forward.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Why… aren’t you saying anything?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero34.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1055" title="hero34" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero34.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>I threw that question at him, despite knowing in my heart that I would never forgive him.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Say it! Say that you had a reason for all this! That you had no choice but to do it!</p>
<p>We get a flashback of Ichijou and Chief talking, with the latter explaining the nature of Muramasa’s curse to the former.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero33.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1054" title="hero33" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero33.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Chief: The moment he slays someone evil, he has to sacrifice someone of pure heart as well. The first of his victims was his own mother, whom he loved dearly. The very reason he keeps on fighting is to put an end to what started on that day. That is why I never stopped him. Even though I should have. If there is anyone who should take the blame… it’s me.</p>
<p>Back to the present.<br>
Ichijou: ………..</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………..</p>
<p>She then thrusts her scorching hot blade deep into Kageaki’s body.</p>
<p>Ichijou: You have sometihng to say?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero35.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056" title="hero35" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero35.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: *cough* You’re piercing… the wrong spot…</p>
<p>Ichijou: What?</p>
<p>Kageaki: A Musha will not die from a wound like this…</p>
<p>Ichijou: You bastard… you’re not done, are you? There’s still something you have to say, am I right?!</p>
<p>Kageki: No. There is… nothing else. I don’t have the right to say any more.</p>
<p>Ichijou: ……..</p>
<p>Kageaki: Defeating the Ginseigou… is up to you now.</p>
<p>Ichijou: W-what?</p>
<p>Kageaki: If you use that Masamune of yours… I’m sure you could defeat her. The rest is up to you.</p>
<p>Ichijou: That’s not what I wanted to hear!!</p>
<p>Kageaki: ….?</p>
<p>Ichijou: All those killings… it wasn’t really your doing, was it? And yet, here you are, accepting your death!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Tell me everything about it! Explain it to me! Tell me that it was the curse that forced your hand!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero36.jpg"><img title="hero36" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero36.jpg" width="584" height="331"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: If only you told me that… if only…</p>
<p>Kageaki: That has… nothing to do with it. A sin is a sin. And evil… is evil. You, who would punish such evil is in the right. Any reasons I might have had… are of little importance.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Sins cannot be forgiven. Evil must be punished.</p>
<p>Flashback of Ichijou’s dad.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero37.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" title="hero37" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero37.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>You are not allowed to forgive me.</em></p>
<p><em>Detest me.</em></p>
<p><em>Detest the sins I have commited.</em></p>
<p><em>Detest the evil I have embraced.</em></p>
<p><em>Hate me.</em></p>
<p><em>Kill me.</em></p>
<p>She finally breaks down in tears.</p>
<p>Ichijou: No… enough already…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou…</p>
<p>She continues sobbing.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Father… please… enough… I don’t want this…!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato… I don’t want you to die…!</p>
<p><em>All I could do was gaze in silence at the sobbing girl clinging onto me.</em><br>
<em>………………</em><br>
Later, we see Ichijou and Kageaki meeting with Chief.</p>
<p>Ichijou: He asked for my help in restoring peace to Yamato. And I accepted. Please, Minato… I’d like you to lend me your aid. I am fully aware of my own inexperience. So… I would like you to be at my side. Please…!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero38.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1059" title="hero38" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero38.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: But, I…</p>
<p><em>She knew very well what such a request entailed. The very moment I would slay an enemy, someone dear to me would have to die as well.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato… you won’t need to take any more lives. I’ll carry that burden for you.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I’ll destroy the Rokuhara by myself. The same goes for the Ginseigou.</p>
<p><em>I will not have to stain my hands with the blood of innocents any longer.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato… please, join us.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Kageaki: …very well. Ayane Ichijou – I will follow your lead.</p>
<p>We get some scenes with the prince, who outlines his plan. We’re basically going to get assistance from Raichou (in exchange for granting him a higher political status), who views Doushin as a thorn in his side (and if you remember, is dissatisifed with the Rokuhara). Using Raichou and his men, Kageaki and Ichijou plan to inflitrate the Rokuhara’s main base of operations, Fudaraku castle (famous for being a castle that was never taken by an enemy) and take care of Doushin.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero38-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060" title="hero38.5" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero38-5.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>They don their disguises and appear before the front gate.</p>
<p>Kageaki: My name is Arata Kageaki. Accompanying me here is Arata Ichihime. We’ve come to take up office within the castle.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero39.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061" title="hero39" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero39.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>They hand them the fake papers and such.</p>
<p>Guard: Very well. Go on inside.</p>
<p>They meet up with Raichou’s agent (lady with the red-black hair on one of the screenshots around here), who takes them to their temporary residence within the castle.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero41.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1065" title="hero41" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero41.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Woman: Please go ahead and use this residence.</p>
<p>Ichijou: *looking at how huge the place is* You mean… this entire place?</p>
<p>Woman: I realize it might be a bit too small for living quarters and might cause some discomfort.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Not at all. It is more than enough. Its location is rather fortunate, as it seems like it’s the farthest away from all the other residences.</p>
<p>Woman: Indeed. It’s the perfect place to talk in secret, away from prying eyes. Even still… don’t let your guard down.</p>
<p>Ichijou: One more thing…</p>
<p>Woman: Yes?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Won’t our presence here be suspicious to outsiders?</p>
<p>Woman: Oh, I don’t think so. You’ll be living here as a married couple, after all.</p>
<p>Ichijou: WHAT?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1066" title="hero42" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero42.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: You weren’t informed of this? I even introduced ourselves when we were at the front gate.</p>
<p>Ichijou! NO! I thought we were supposed to be just siblings or something!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Appearing as a married couple is necessary for us to be able to lodge together. Getting separated here would be problematic.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I get that, b-but…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Is there a problem with it?</p>
<p>Ichijou: *blushing* W-well, um…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Do you have a problem with appearing as my wife?</p>
<p>(Man, Kageaki, you really know what to say to get her all worked up.)</p>
<p>Ichijou: W-well… you know… that’s not…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero43.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1067" title="hero43" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero43.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I do have a problem with it.</p>
<p>Ichijou: *sobbing* B-but… but…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Marriage is a sacred vow to be taken before the divines. Creating it artificially like this is really bothering me.</p>
<p>Ichijou: O-okay…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Putting that aside, though, it is my pleasure to be able to live together with a beauty such as yourself.</p>
<p>Embarrassment of epic proportions follows.</p>
<p>In any case, they decide to get on with gathering information within the castle, and eventually, they gain entrance to Doushin’s room in order to meet him and see what kind of guy he is.</p>
<p>Kageaki reports about the severe food situation in some area, then the flood damages in some other area and Doushin suggests bringing up the issue with Chachamaru. Kageaki does all the talking while Ichijou remains silent. After the talk is done, though, Doushin turns to Ichijou. Kageaki, realizing that it’d be troublesome to let her talk (her hate for the Rokuhara might show + she’s not especially good at the polite use of Japanese), tries to cut in.</p>
<p>Doushin: It’s fine, it’s fine. Crudeness has a certain charm if it leaves the lips of beautiful young maiden, is it not so? Let her talk.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero45.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1069" title="hero45" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero45.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I see…</p>
<p>Doushin: So then. How do you like this castle?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Well, um… it’s really big. But it all seems like a waste of money to me.</p>
<p>Doushin: How so?</p>
<p>Ichijou: What? Can’t you see?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichij- Ichihime…!!</p>
<p>Doushin: Please, go ahead and educate me.</p>
<p>Ichijou: It’s very simple. There’s no such thing as an unpenetrable fortress. So if this castle will fall sooner or later, it’s pointless to pour so much money into it.</p>
<p>Doushin: Ohoho! Sir, your wife’s words betray the mind of a true sage!</p>
<p>Doushin: It is true that plenty of money and resources were used to build this castle. However. I would not call it useless. Do you know why?</p>
<p>Ichijou: N-no…</p>
<p>Doushin: To show off! The fact that we built such an enormous castle surely takes everyone’s breath away! Ahahahaha!</p>
<p>He lets out a hearty guffaw.</p>
<p>Doushin: However, look at this spoon made of bamboo. It is extremely rare – only a few exist of it in the world. However, it really is a flimsy little thing. It will break should you accidentally step on it. Fudaraku castle is the same – a fearsome thing on the outside, but in reality nothing but a paper tiger. Appareances are all that count. Here, you can have it.</p>
<p>He throws the spoon in Ichijou’s direction, which lands in her palm.</p>
<p>Doushin: Take it as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Kageaki: B-but, my lord…</p>
<p>Doushin: Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s actually just an ear scratcher. I said there were only a few of it in existence – that’s because I made them myself. Ahahaha!</p>
<p>Another guffaw.</p>
<p>Ichijou: You goddamn priest…!</p>
<p>Doushin: Oh, was my joke not to your liking? Forgive me. In any case, that will be all for today. Thank you for the report.<br>
On their way back, they run into a dark haired girl who seems to be lost. They offer to show her the way, but due to Ichijou’s terrible sense of direction, they get lost themselves. Kageaki apologizes, but the girl says it’s fine, and introduces herself as Okabe Sakurako.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero47.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1071" title="hero47" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero47.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou and Kageaki recognize the Okabe name as belonging to someone whose rebellion Shishiku supressed. She is that person’s daughter. Basically, they are a distinguished family that was thus robbed of all its wealth and honor and was forced into servitude under the Rokuhara after their defeat.<br>
Ichijou is staring at her.</p>
<p>Sakurako: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Ah, I… I was just thinking how pretty you were.</p>
<p>Sakurako: *blushing* Th-thank you… but, the other ladies living within the palace are much more beautiful than me.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1073" title="hero49" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero49.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Oh, I didn’t just mean your clothes or appearance! I mean… you give off the aura of being a real princess…</p>
<p>Kageaki: That’s because she *is* one!</p>
<p>Sakurako: *giggles* Ahaha, I like you two! You’re nothing like the others in the Shogunate.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Actually, we’ve just moved here recently ourselves.</p>
<p>Sakurako: I see. So you’re just like me. I’m always having difficulty finding my way around here…</p>
<p>They continue talking a bit, and as it turns out, Sakurako has a terrible sense of direction as well. Needless to say, she and Ichijou hit it off immediately.</p>
<p>Sakurako: Wouldn’t it be nice if there were only straight roads without any forks? No one would get lost that way!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1075" title="hero50" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero50.jpg" width="584" height="330"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes! I completely agree!</p>
<p>Eventually, they find their way back to where Sakurako wanted to go.<br>
Sakurako: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p>Sakurako: U-um…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes?</p>
<p>Sakura: Well, um… should we run into each other once again… please, don’t hesitate to call out to me…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero51.jpg"><img title="hero51" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero51.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: With pleasure.</p>
<p>She is about to leave, when Ichijou stops her.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Um…&nbsp;&nbsp;just one more thing…</p>
<p>Sakurako: Yes?</p>
<p>Ichijou: I’d like to ask you something. How do you feel about the Rokuhara? Your current postition… and how they defeated and killed your father?</p>
<p>Sakurako: ……</p>
<p>Ichijou: …….</p>
<p>Sakurako: I have nothing to say on the matter. Bending the knee to the victor is the duty of the defeated. Therefore, I have no right to say anything about the Rokuhara… or my father. It would tarnish the honor of my family.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Ah, I’m sorry for asking something personal…</p>
<p>She then leaves.</p>
<p>Later, at night, Kageaki reminds himself that he didn’t only came here due to the prince’s order. He is also following up on Aoe’s dying words, who mentioned the Rokuhara when asked about Hikaru. And what better place to look than the Fudaraku Castle, the central headquarters of the Shogunate.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero52.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1077" title="hero52" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero52.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa is here as well, and both of them conclude that they haven’t progressed in their investigation. The inner castle still seems inpenetrable to them.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I haven’t been able to find out anything, either.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Or rather, you were too busy playing around with that girl to do so?</p>
<p>There was no need to clarify who she was talking about.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I cannot deny that. However, I have not forgotten our mission.</p>
<p>Muramasa: In that case… fine.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Is there a problem?</p>
<p>Muramasa: A problem? You mean that girl? Or what you’re doing right now? It’s… fine. I don’t care about the fact that you’re lending your aid to that girl, or that you’re getting involved with the local power struggles. Like I said, it’s fine by me.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Then what *is* your problem?</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. Ever since the day I have sworn to follow Ichijou, Muramasa has grown distant from me.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou. Don’t let your guard down around Masamune. He will not let you off the hook so easily. The same goes for that girl.</p>
<p>The red spider then leaves, and Kageaki turns to Ichijou sleeping next to him.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou.</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. However, I knew by looking at her that she wasn’t asleep yet.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Why couldn’t you bring yourself to kill me that day…?</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>The next day, Kageaki goes out to investigate and runs into none otehr than Kuniuji, the current leader of the Rokuhara. He’s busy playing with a football alone while being surrounded by a dozen guards and attendands. Kageaki notes how lonely it all looks. Eventually, he kicks the ball too hard and his shoes fly off, with the ball itself rolling in Kageaki’s direction. The two then begin to talk – the guards are astonished that a lowly-ranking citizen like Kageaki would dare to address the Rokuhara’s leader, but Kuniuji quickly silences them. Kageaki places the shoe of the boy back on his foot and ties his laces for him – apparently he was never taught how to do it by himself.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Thank you.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero53.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1078" title="hero53" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero53.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki briefly explains to him the proper way to use his legs and position himself when handling the football, and then proceeds to actually show him how to do it.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Wooow~ Amazing! You’re just as good as big sis Chacha!</p>
<p><em>The boy who silenced the guards a minute ago with a commanding voice now looked at Kageaki with admiration and a boyish innocence – this was probably his real personality.</em></p>
<p><em>After only 30 minutes, he got the hang of it – much faster than expected. He undoubtedly had talent.</em></p>
<p>Kuniji: Where did you learn how to do this?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I dabbled in football in my younger days. I was part of the rear guard in a team.</p>
<p>Kuniju: Wow! Do you think I could one day play in a team as well?</p>
<p>Kageaki: With your talent…</p>
<p><em>…surely. – That is what I thought, but I couldn’t bring myself to finish the sentence. The boy before me, burdened with the responsiblity to lead the Rokuhara, would never be given that chance. I knew this all too well.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Sakurako shows up. Looking in Kuniuji’s direction, she beings to talk.</p>
<p>Sakurako: You are very skilled.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: *blushing* Th-thank you…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079" title="hero54" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero54.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Sakurako: It’s called soccer, is it not?</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Y-yes, it’s a sport usually played in teams, though…</p>
<p>They exchange a few words, then she prepares to leave.</p>
<p><em>As she passed by me, she looked at me with a bittersweet expression that posed the question – “What exactly are you doing here, sir?”</em></p>
<p><em>What indeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Sakurako, without uttering another word, turned her back on Kuniuji and left. She had no allies within this prison called Fudaraku – her beauty was but a bereft flower, forced to bloom in the midst of a barren wasteland.</em></p>
<p>Kuniju: Who… was that person? Do you happen know her?</p>
<p>Kageaki: That was Lady Sakurako from the House Okabe.</p>
<p>Kuniju: Okabe…!</p>
<p><em>He gasped as he recongnized the meaning behind that name – the family that was crushed by the Rokuhara with its last descendant imprisoned behind the walls of the castle.</em></p>
<p><em>Ashikaga Kuniuji. Okabe Sakurako. The victor and the defeated. An ordinary boy and an ordinary girl.</em></p>
<p>The scene ends, and we see Kageaki on the road, having returned to his investigation.</p>
<p>He spots Ichijou standing in the field, gazing at a group of girls picking flowers.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080" title="hero55" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero55.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>Calling her a doll of sorts would be incorrect. A doll or a puppet is something that complteley lacks emotion – she was different. Her mind was focused on one idea, one goal: justice. Rather than a doll, she resembled… a machine.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: I wonder if she’s really happy…</p>
<p><em>That one sentence, that one idea finally gained a concrete form in my mind. For the first time, I was able to properly formulate the words.</em></p>
<p><em>“Can a machine feel sorrow?”</em></p>
<p><em>I had no answer to that question. However, there was one thing I was certain of. A machine will continue to function and work towards the one single objective it was given. It will go on and on, till the moment it finally breaks.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Ah, Minato…</p>
<p>She continues gazing at the girls gleefully picking flowers.</p>
<p>Ichijou: What do you see before you?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero56.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1081" title="hero56" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero56.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Peace. Happiness.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Are you… envious of it? Their happiness? Their peace?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes. I am. It truly is something to be envied. However, it is only a matter of wealth distribution – some have it easy, others live in poverty. Which is fine by me. I am no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Plekhanov">Plekhanov</a>, you see.</p>
<p>Ichijou: However, those who come into wealth by robbing others of everything with brute force… people like that are undeniably evil.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Such things aren’t exclusive to this land. It happens everywhere, in every society. Nature itself works like that. Strong animals prey upon the weak – the survival of the fittest, as it is called.</p>
<p>Ichijou: True. Robbing others of something is evil, whether or not it is done consciously. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Kageaki: No, you’re not. It is exactly as you say.</p>
<p><em>She was right. A sin is a sin. Evil is evil. Regardless of how it is justified.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Thank you.</p>
<p><em>A beatiful, honest smile formed on her lips. Beautiful and feminine.</em></p>
<p><em>I was mesmerized by the fact that she would be capable of such a smile at a time like this. A smile that would normally be reserved for an occasion when one is whispering sweet words into a lover’s ear.</em></p>
<p><em>Ayane Ichijou functions almost like a machine. That is something I am certain of. However… can I truly let the feelings pressing against my heart at this very moment slip away into nothingness?</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou. To my eyes, you resemble a magnificent blade.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Um, I… I see…</p>
<p><em>She produced yet another smile, as if receieving the highest form of praise. Seeing it made my chest tighten even more.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: However, from time to time, that quality can make the hearts of men tremble with fear. Such a thing would not be advantageous in our current situation.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I s-see… but, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Every blade has a sheath. It softens its image and makes it shine in gentler colors.</p>

<p>He takes out a hairpin (see screenshot) and hands it to her.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Is… this for me?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero58.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083" title="hero58" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero58.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes. Is it not to your liking?</p>
<p>Ichijou: *blushes* N-no no no! That’s not what I meant! D-did you, um… pick this out for me by yourself?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes.</p>
<p>Ichijou: So you bought it only for me…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: That is correct.</p>
<p>Ichijou: W-w-what should I say…? I mean, um… well… i-it’s my first time receiving something like this from a man…! Thank you so much!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero60.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1086" title="hero60" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero60.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>I gently placed it in her hair. I noticed that she was waiting for me to say something.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: It looks good on you.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Ah…!<br>
The next day, the two of them agree on their plan. They will attempt to attack Kuniuji (without taking his life, obviously) and create enough of an uprorar so that Doushin’s position as his guardian will be questioned, and he will be demoted and weakened. The prince and Raichou will use this as an opportunity to take over. Their target will the the local theatre sponsored by Doushin himself. However, the problem is that only high ranking officials are usually invited.</p>
<p>They are interrupted by thir female agent (with the reddish hair), who is now accompanied by one of Kuniuji’s female attendants. The attendant recognizes Kageaki and informs him that Kuniuji wishes to meet with him.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Ah, Arata! I knew you would come.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your Highness.<br>
…</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Say, Arata… do girls fancy flowers?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero61.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1087" title="hero61" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero61.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Well… I would say it’s as much of a stereotype as the one about boys loving baseball and only eating meat. However, there are girls, like my own sister, who, upon recieving flowers or the occasional love letter, would make the unlucky sender end up in a hospital with injuries so grave he wouldn’t be able to walk right for a month.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Who is this about, if I may ask?</p>
<p>Kuniuji: U-um… Lady Sakurako…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I see.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: The other day when we met, she was so…<br>
………<br>
Long, awkward silence.<br>
Kuniuji: *blushing* U-um, where was I?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I do believe you stopped at “so”.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: A-ah! I see.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: The thing is… she is Okabe, while I am Ashikaga. I want the animosity between our families to be a thing of the past – water under the bridge! But… she is still plagued by the recent tragedy that befell her father. I was wondering if there was anything I could do to ease her pain…</p>
<p>Kageaki: And that’s where the flowers come in.</p>
<p>Kuniju: Yes. What is your take on all of this, Arata?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your Highness. First, I have to ask – why did you call on me, of all people?</p>
<p>Kuniuji: There was… there was no one else I could turn to.</p>
<p><em>Amongst his followers and attendants, this boy had not a single person who would lend an ear to his worries, that was true.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: You honor me with such words.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: I am glad you feel that way! So, what do you think? Would she cheer up if I gave her a flower as a present? Or is there something else that would be more suitable…?</p>
<p>He basically tells Kuniuji that what he sends doesn’t matter as much as the sentiment itself. So he should just pick whatever he feels is right.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Alright! It’ll be a flower, then! Thank you, Arata – you really lifted a weight off my shoulders!</p>
<p>He sends Kageaki to deliever the flower, and we cut to Sakurako’s room.</p>
<p>Sakurako: If I’m not mistaken, this flower, the “araseito”, symbolizes eternal beauty and love.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero62.jpg"><img title="hero62" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero62.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: As well as sympathy, and the strength to move on.</p>
<p>Sakurako: Symphathy… the strength to move on… and His Highness went out of his way to send me this…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Do you consider it to be in poor taste?</p>
<p><em>Her eyes widened at my crude words. However, it only lasted a few seconds.</em></p>
<p>Sakurako: Yes. The victor can always retains his pride, while the defeated have nothing to cling onto other than the fact that they fought bravely.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am not surprised you feel that way. However, His Highness did not send this gift as the victor. I believe he sent this as a person who feels that he is in the same psotiion as yourself.</p>
<p>Sakurako: The same… position?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Recall that this flower also symbolizes sympathy. His Highness’s sentiment isn’t that of a ruler extending a helping hand to a low-ranking person he took pity on, but rather that of a boy who wishes to be your support in hard times as an equal.</p>
<p>Sakurako: He must be a lonely person…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Friendship and love is a luxury that those destined to sit the throne can rarely afford.</p>
<p>Sakurako: He desires the warmth of companionship to escape the chilly weight of his throne… am I correct?</p>
<p><em>I nodded.</em></p>
<p>She then sends a message back to Kuniuji.</p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s some sort of a reference, because it seemed like a quote from something. (I Googled it, and came upon some old Japanese tale written by an unknown author. If you’re reading this and you’re pro at Japanese, feel free to send me a message if you want to help.) I can only guess (based on the context and the charater’s reactions) that it is something suggestive. Upon hearing Sakurako’s answer from Kageaki, Kuniuji blushes and nearly faints. Kageaki concludes that Sakurako, despite her innocent appearance, can be quite mischievous at times.</p>
<p>At night, Kageaki is talking with Muramasa. She reports that she senses no trace of the Ginseigou or her eggs within the castle.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero63.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089" title="hero63" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero63.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>The next morning, Raichou’s agent reports to Kageaki that Doushin allowed even lower ranking personnel (like us) to attend the theatre as a gesture of gratitude towards all residents. In fact, we were ordered to attend. Refusing it would be suspicious, Kageaki concludes. In any case, they decide to go.</p>
<p>We’re now at the theatre. Kageaki and Ichijou notice Sakurako in the crowd. She is now wearing the flower she got from Kuniuji as a hair ornament. She exchanges a look with Kuniuji, and Kagaeki gazes at the two youngsters with approval. Ichijou is confused as hell, naturally.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero65.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1091" title="hero65" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero65.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>The play begins, and the everyone except Doushin is shocked by its content – it’s basically a performance that -in rather poor taste, considering that she’s in the audience- reenacts the defeat of Sakurako’s deceased father.</p>
<p>Sakurako: Father…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero66.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1092" title="hero66" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero66.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Then, the actor playing the lead part, still dressed in his costume, jumps off the stage and in front of Sakurako. He tears off his costume and reveals himself to be none other than Doushin. Kageaki glances towards the seast where Doushin was supposed to be sitting in the audience, and notices a shady looking dude (Jouan) – he was no doubt his body double during the performance, pretending to be Doushin in the audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero67.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1093" title="hero67" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero67.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Sakurako: Lord Doushin…!</p>
<p>Doushin: I am deeply sorry for having startled you, my Lady. Please, if you would be so kind, think of this affair as nothing more than the peculiar pasttime of an aging man such as I.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero68.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1094" title="hero68" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero68.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>He then goes on and tells her a tale of her father. As it turns out, Doushin himself fought side by side him many years ago. He tells her how her father would even sacrifice his comrades for the sake of the greater good, and that he was indeed a magnificent warrior in his youth.</p>
<p>Doushin: He never regretted his actions. Yet his shame over the deed was immense. I take it he has not told you tales of his military efforts?</p>
<p>Sakurako: No… no matter how much I begged him, no tales of the battlefield would leave his lips in my presence.</p>
<p>Doushin: I see. Lady Sakurako – will you hear me out? Your father was a magnificent man – and for that very reason, I do not wish to see his tale remain untold! Will you allow me to honor his memory in such a way?</p>
<p>(He means the theatre.)</p>
<p>Sakurako: Y-yes… Lord Doushin.</p>
<p>Sakurako: However, having heard such words of Father’s past… my desire to meet him once again grows ever so deeper…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero69.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1095" title="hero69" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero69.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>She begins crying.</p>
<p>Doushin: My, my. I have made you cry. At a time like this, alcohol is the best medicine. Lady Sakurako, do have a cup.</p>
<p>He hands her a bowl with some sake.</p>
<p>Sakurako: Forgive me, Lord Doushin, for making you see me in such a miserable state…</p>
<p>Doushin: Think nothing of it. Are not the innocent tears of a young girl remembering his dear father anything but unnatural? It is hardly a crime, nor a thing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Kageaki watches the two from a distance, with anxiety in his heart, unsure of what to make of their exchange.</p>
<p>Ichijou notes that she is feeling slightly sick. In any case, their conversation goes on.</p>
<p>Doushin: Lady Sakurako, if you would accept this…</p>
<p>Sakurako: A mask…?</p>
<p>(It’s the mask Doushin was wearing while he was playing the part of Sakurako’s father.)</p>
<p>Doushin: Indeed. I carved it myself. I think it would be appropriate if I left it in your care. Will you accept it?</p>
<p>Sakurako: With pleasure! My, it truly resembles Father’s face…<br>
………….<br>
………….<br>
………….<br>
Doushin: Of course it does. After all, I made it using his very bones.</p>
<p>(WHAT.)</p>
<p>Sakurako: Wha… what did you just say…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero70.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" title="hero70" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero70.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Doushin: As I’ve said – it’s made from his remains. Using a saw, I…</p>
<p>He’s gesturing with his hands, showing the very motions.</p>
<p>Doushin: …sliced it in two. I had to scrape off all the flesh as well. Then came the chisel, like this…</p>
<p>Again, he’s showing her the motions.</p>
<p>Doushin: It turned out rather nicely, did it not? It was quite the job. Making that bowl was such an easier task! I made that from the skull of your brother, Okabe Jyuubei. It is the very bowl you’ve just drank sake from.</p>
<p>Doushin: Was the taste of your dear brother’s corpse to your liking, Lady Sakurako…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero71.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" title="hero71" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero71.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Sakurako screams in horror, while the bald priest begins laughing like a madman. He then grabs her by the hand and takes her to the stage. Sakurako snaps and begins screaming uncontrollably atop the stage.</p>
<p>Doushin: Yes, just like that! More! More! Let me hear that beautiful voice of yours!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero72.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1099" title="hero72" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero72.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: That piece of sh-</p>
<p>Kageaki: Keep your voice down, Ichijou. And don’t move.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Look over there. One move and we’re done for.</p>
<p>He points towards the armored guards, all serving under Doushin and being led by Jouan.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero73.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100" title="hero73" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero73.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Dammit…!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Doushin, how dare you! Stop this at once!</p>
<p>Doushin: I don’t believe I’ve heard you clearly, Your Highness.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: W-what?!</p>
<p>Doushin: We’re in the middle of a performance, have you forgotten? The audience must never leave their seats, no matter the disturbance. I will hear you out once this is over. Until then, however…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero74.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101" title="hero74" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero74.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kuniuji: Have you lost your senses?! I am ordering you to stop at once!</p>
<p>Doushin: If that is indeed your wish… I urge you to order your guard to do soemthing about it.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: *to all the armored soldiers wearing Tsurugi* Stop him!</p>
<p>The armored troops do not react.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: What are you doing? Was my order not clear enough?! Stop Doushin this very instant!</p>
<p>No reaction.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: I care not who it is! Someone come forward and stop Doushin!</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Kuniuji: Why do you answer with silence…? Someone… anyone, come to my aid!</p>
<p>Doushin tells him he should stop him with his own two hands if he wants it so badly. Kuniuji nearly faints.</p>
<p>Doushin: Well then, Lady Sakurako. I apologize for making you wait.</p>
<p>He takes the violet flower -Kuniuji’s gift- from her hair, crumples it up and tosses it away.</p>
<p>Doushin: You see, the object of my desire is a flower of a different kind…</p>
<p>He then forcibly grabs Sakurako from behind, spreads her legs and rapes her in front of Kuniuji.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sakurako-crp.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916" title="sakurako-crp" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/sakurako-crp.png" width="584" height="105"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Yup, this is all I can safely show you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero75.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102" title="hero75" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero75.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We cut to a bit later, with Kageaki’s thoughts being narrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero77.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1104" title="hero77" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero77.jpg" width="584" height="319"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Ichijou was on fire – there was no holding her back any longer. Should I decide to conduct the investigation alone, she would immediately begin acting on her own, blindly following her ideal to the very end. I shuddered at the thought of letting her out of my sight. It would be no different from murder. The blood trickling from the mountain of corpses she would leave in her wake would stain my hands as well.</em></p>
<p><em>To avoid such an outcome, I would follow her wherever she went.</em></p>
<p>So basically, Kageaki, Ichijou, Muramasa and Masamune are preparing to sneak into the inner castle under cover of darkness. Raichou’s informant had previously made sure that a certain doorway would remain unlocked, so entry to the castle shouldn’t be too difficult, she concludes.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero78.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1105" title="hero78" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero78.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero79.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1106" title="hero79" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero79.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>They sneak in, but are soon discovered by Jouan, Doushin a dozen of their armored troops. Doushin grabs Raichou’s informant and cuts her throat, killing her instantly. There’s a sort of an explosion, and things go dark for a little while. When the light comes back on, Kageaki and Ichijou quickly become separated. The former is being chased by a dozen armored troops and Jouan, while the latter confronts Doushin himself.</p>
<p>Doushin: Ah, you must be the wife of Arata.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Ayane Ichijou!</p>
<p>Doushin: I take it that is your real name? I don’t suppose you came here looking for an escape route… am I right?</p>
<p>Ichijou: It should be clear as day that I came here to take your head!</p>
<p>Doushin: Oh… you desire my demise that much?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero81.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1109" title="hero81" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero81.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes. What you did was unforgivable.</p>
<p>Doushin: You wish to let your blade taste my flesh…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Indeed. Your bald head will make a fine lamppost atop this castle. I’ll tear the flesh from your body, break your bones and grind them to dust. I’ll rip your innards out and feed them to the dogs. I’ll gouge your eyes out and give it to hungering crows, along with that miserable thing between your legs. And you’ll be alive for every second of it!</p>
<p>Doushin: And may I ask why you intend to do those things?</p>
<p>Ichijou: You dare ask me that…?! It’s for everything you’ve done to Lady Sakurako! How could you do that?!</p>
<p>Doushin: I did it simply because I wanted to!</p>
<p>Ichijou: And what about her father…? Doing such a thing to a “beloved” friend’s remains is hardly what I would call honoring his memory.</p>
<p>Doushin: Oh, that? I suppose… I simply imagined it would be an enjoyable pasttime.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Doushin: So, it seems like you believe I should be punished for those deeds. By whom, I ask?</p>
<p>Ichjou: …..?!</p>
<p>Doushin: The laws of men? Power and influence can overcome that. Or should I expect divine punishment? If the heavens wanted to punish me, how come that I’ve managed to live this long in peace and idleness without accident or illness…?</p>
<p>Doushin: I ask you again – who or what exactly could possibly punish me?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Me. To hell with the laws of men and divines! I, alone, shall take your head!</p>
<p>Doushin: Ichijou, was it? Under whose orders are you acting, if I may ask?</p>
<p>Ichijou: I act alone.</p>
<p>Doushin: I wonder what it is you intend to gain by killing me. Money? Political status? Is that it?</p>
<p>Ichijou: You’re so full of shit. Do you honestly think anyone would pay a single penny in exchange for your worthless life?</p>
<p>Doushin: In other words… anger and rage is what sustains you? That alone is what guides your hand? You do this for the sake of your own idea of justice?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Correct. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero83.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1111" title="hero83" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero83.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Doushin, upon seeing Masamune, gets all excited and welcomes the challenge with open arms.</p>
<p>Ichijou: So, it seems like you’re prepared to meet your maker.</p>
<p>Doushin: Quite the opposite! Crushing you will make my life complete! The heavens will see that a man as depraved as I, his life filled with lust and greed, can go to his deathbed unchallenged and unpunished!</p>
<p>Ichijou calls for Masamune.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>As long as the devil lives, my blade shall pierce its heart.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>As long as evil persists, my steel shall know the taint of blood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Therein lies the way of the sword.</em></p>
<p>Doushin then summons his own Tsurugi.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero85.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113" title="hero85" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero85.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero86.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114" title="hero86" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero86.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>So they begin fighting, and we cut back to Kageaki and Jouan, also fighting. Kageaki recognizes the sword technique used by his enemy – Rokuhara Shinkage-Ryu. He tells Jouan that in the past, he had to face an opponent who used the same techniques.</p>
<p>Jouan: And who might that person be…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichigao Mizuhi.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero91.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1120" title="hero91" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero91.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Jouan: I see, I see. It all makes sense now.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You know her?</p>
<p>Jouan: I personally instructed her in the way of the sword. She had what I can only describe as natural talent. How fares she at present?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Two years ago… she died to protect her honor. I have nothing else to tell you.</p>
<p>Jouan: Very well.</p>
<p>The fight continues, and Jouan ends up cutting off Kageaki’s left hand by the wrist. (don’t worry, though, Muramasa’s healing powers are there, so it’s more or less fine and will heal in a couple of days. Yes, the healing capabilities of Tsurugi are pretty awesome, as it as already demonstrated with Hikaru in Chapter 5.)</p>
<p>We then back with Ichijou and Doushin. The fight itself is shown from Ichijou’s perspective. (Her blue/purple Tsurugi interface is a nice change of scenery from Muramasa’s red one.) The two keep on fighting, and we also see a very brief scene with Sakurako in her chambers, listening to the uproar all around the castle due to Doushin and Ichijou’s fight. Some dude then comes into her room and tells her that he’s come to pick her up.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero90.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1119" title="hero90" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero90.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>We’re back with Ichijou, who’s getting annoyed with Doushin. She orders Masamune to use her flesh and blood – she uses the cannon and fires and Doushin.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero89.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" title="hero89" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero89.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Huge explosion.</p>
<p>Masamune: Ahahahaha!! Behold the triumph of justice! The painful screams of the wicked!</p>
<p>(His borderline psycho and completely bloodthirsty attitude doesn’t quite come through in text, I guess. His voice acting is pretty crazy, though.)</p>
<p>Masamune: In any case, Midou. It is hardly a matter to be worried about, but that bastard did damage your right leg just now…</p>
<p>Ichijou: In other words, I won’t be able to remain in the air forever in this state… I wonder if Minato made it out okay? Could you confirm whether or not they had escaped?</p>
<p>Masamune: Pfft. I care not for his well-being.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I said confirm it, damn you!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero92.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1121" title="hero92" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero92.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Masamune: Hmpf. Who cares about that worthless fool of a man?</p>
<p>Ichijou: I do…</p>
<p>Masamune: But why…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: He’s on our side.</p>
<p>Masamune: For now. But he’ll turn on us eventually. We can only hope that he met his end fighting amongst the clouds – it would save us the trouble of having to hunt him down.</p>
<p>Ichijou: ………</p>
<p>Masamune: However… that would also rob us of the opportunity to take his head ourselves, don’t you agree, Midou?</p>
<p>Ichijou: ………</p>
<p>Masamune: Could it be… that you have forgiven his sins?</p>
<p><em>The moment the blacksmith forges his own self into a Tsurugi, his very soul becomes one with the steel. His rigid body might contain a soul, yet his emotions remain the same, ever unwavering, untouched by the ripples of time. However, that is only true under normal circumstances.</em></p>
<p><em>Masamune was different – his voice carried a passion that rivaled, even surpassed, that of a human being. And yet, the voice he used to talk to me just now betrayed no trace of emotion – it was cold as ice itself, as Tsurugi should be.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I haven’t. It’s just that… I believe in his redemption. That he could make things right.</p>
<p>Masasmune: No path exists that would lead a sinner towards redemption.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I… I know. B-but… I need his help! I can’t take on the Shogunate alone. And as long as he’s with me, he won’t take another life.</p>
<p>Masamune: Once a sinner, always a sinner. That man will one day betray you, Midou.</p>
<p>Ichijou: He won’t…</p>
<p>Masamune: And what if he does?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Should that time come… he will die by my blade.</p>
<p>Masamune: ………..</p>
<p>Ichijou: Still not good enough of an answer for you?</p>
<p>Masamune: Midou. Villains will fight till the bitter end, clinging onto their miserable lives. That man will not let himself be killed that easily.</p>
<p>Their talk is then interrupted by Doushin, who’s apparently not quite ready to die just yet. His turtle armor protected him from the blast earlier. He hits Ichijou hard, and she begins to fall. However, Masamune activates another one of his superpowers and attempt to burn Doushin alive in his armor.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero95.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" title="hero95" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero95.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>We cut back to Kageaki, who realizes that he does not actually need to defeat Jouan. All he needs to do is break through him and escape. So he does that. Jouan then orders his men to pursue him.</p>
<p>All of his armored underlings run off, except for one.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero96.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1125" title="hero96" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero96.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Jouan: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Soldier: Boss… I apologize for being rude, but… my sensors aren’t picking up any enemies from that direction, but rather… from your direction.</p>
<p>Jouan: ……….</p>
<p>Soldier: I-is it a malfunction…?</p>
<p>Jouan: Munetora.</p>
<p>Munetora: Y-yes, boss?</p>
<p>Jouan: No need for the formalities.</p>
<p>Munetora: As you wish… uncle.</p>
<p>Jouan: If I’m not mistaken, you have recently transferred here to take up the post of your late brother, who fell in battle.</p>
<p>Munetora: Yes.</p>
<p>Jouan: After only six months of training, you’re capable of seeing this current situation for what it really is. Such level-headedness. You really are a promising candidate.</p>
<p>Munetora: U-uncle…</p>
<p>Jouan: No, let me correct myself. You *were* a promising candidate. It truly pains me that you will not live to see tomorrow.</p>
<p>Munetora: H-huh…?</p>
<p>Jouan: I shall pray that in the next life, you will be born as a less intelligent creature. O heavens – Deus, forgive mine sins.</p>
<p>And then he kills him. That was weird.</p>
<p>Back to Ichijou. Doushin unleashed a fiery attack, and Masamune suggests using his Shinogi. Basically his strongest attack, his trump card.</p>
<p>Ichijou: So if we use that… we’ll be able to win?</p>
<p>Masamune: Aye! Masamune knows no defeat!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Alright… so what should I do?</p>
<p>Masamune: Nothing.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Nothing?</p>
<p>Masamune: Indeed. And one more thing.</p>
<p>Ichijou: W-what…?</p>
<p>Masamune: Try not to die. If you can endure till the end without dying, victory shall be ours.</p>
<p>(So I’m guessing this next attack will use up an insane amount of Ichijou’s life.)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero94.jpg"><img title="hero94" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero94.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Even Kagaeki notices it after escaping from Jouan.</p>
<p>Kageaki: What in the world was that…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero98.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1127" title="hero98" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero98.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p><em>It was different from a natural fire, that much I could tell.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: It was a Shinogi, no doubt about it. I can feel the very flow of its power. That flame was conjured up by a Tsurugi.</p>
<p>They decide to go an investigate.</p>
<p>We cut back to the now-ruined palace.</p>
<p>Doushin: It seems like the path I have chosen led me to an early grave.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Of course it did. It was never the right path to begin with.</p>
<p>Doushin: Evil pays the price. Justice… prevails. Hahaha…. hahahaha!</p>
<p>Ichijou: What’s so funny?!</p>
<p>Doushin: Isn’t it obvious? Evil received its just punishment, after all. I have to laugh at how absurd it all is. How come you don’t join me in laughter? Your precious justice conquered my evil. You are the victor! So laugh, with your head held high! Ridicule the defeated, mock his agony!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero99.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1128" title="hero99" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero99.jpg" width="584" height="330"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Shut up!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero100.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919" title="hero100" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero100.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>He loses himself in an insane cackle, and continues to laugh even as Ichijou stabs him repeatedly until he finally dies.</p>
<p>Kageaki lands near her a few minutes later.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Ah… ah…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou! What happened here?!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Mi… M-Minato… I…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero101.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920" title="hero101" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero101.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>She pointed towards the nearby wreckage. Her finger then fell back to her side, as if lifeless.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I fought Yusa Doushin, and… I… I killed him…</p>
<p><em>I looked at the nearby wreckage as well. Once I’ve taken a good look, I confirmed that it was indeed Yusa Doushin, his remains -blood, flesh, bones- mixed in with scraps of metal.</em></p>
<p><em>This was enemy territory. We needed to escape to a safer location as soon as possible. Taking a few moments before our departure, I directed my gaze up towards the evening sky, still dancing in the colors of fire, and whispered a few words to myself.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero102.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921" title="hero102" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero102.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>How did things turn out like this…?</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>And then we cut to… well… I’ll let the screenshot speak for itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero103.jpg"><img title="hero103" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero103.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Soldier: Lord Raichou!</p>
<p>Raichou: How dare you interrupt my Morning Beauty Time! So, what is it?</p>
<p>Soldier: Last night, a group of terrorists infiltrated Fudaraku Castle!</p>
<p>Raichou: Oh my. That is a serious matter indeed. (thinking: Very good! At this rate, the Shogunate will be mine!)</p>
<p>Soldier: They caused an immense amount of damage, and… and… even Lord Yusa Doushin met a tragic end…!</p>
<p>Raichou: WHAAAAAAAAAAT?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero104.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923" title="hero104" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero104.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>We then cut to Clive and his suprerior, discussing the attack on the Rokuhara. They basically conclude that now that the Shogunate has suffered such heavy losses, their plan fell apart, and even the resources they poured into making “The Gadget” (the bomb from Kanae’s route) ended up being a wasted effort.</p>
<p>(So basically, everything that they did manage to accomplish during Kanae’s route, the airship, the bombing and everything, is basically out of their reach now.)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero105.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924" title="hero105" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero105.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>For those of you who are reading Ichijou’s route first without having first read Kanae’s route, here’s the gist of it: basically, if you remember from Chapter 4, the GHQ’s plan was to weaken the Shogunate and making it into the ultimate scapegoat, then come riding into the country as saviors who will liberate the land of Yamato from their evil tyranny. They would’ve done this by dropping a bomb on Fudaraku Castle, eliminating the Rokuhara in one swift move. In Kanae’s route, they do actually accomplish this, and the entire castle blows sky high. However, this time, due to Kageaki and Ichijou’s infiltration into Fudaraku and the losses suffered by the Rokuhara, they can hardly act as saviors anymore and look good at the same time: after all, no one would accept the GHQ as “legitimate” conquerors if they basically came in and defeated a Shogunate that was already on the brink of collapse anyway.</p>
<p>Okay, moving on with the actual summary.</p>
<p>However, they are still thinking of rearranging their priorities and coming up with new plan.</p>
<p>We briefly cut to the streets of Kamakura, where people are whispering about the grim future of Yamato. They’re also blaming the mysterious crimson Musha for the assassination of Moriuji. There’s a general unrest amonst the population.</p>
<p>We’re then back with Kageaki reporting the mission to the prince.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero106.jpg"><img title="hero106" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero106.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>He concludes that it was a failure – the prince’s objective was to manipulate the power relations within the Shogunate to serve his own needs. Its complete destruction wasn’t our goal. However, with the death of Doushin and the damage caused by Kageaki and Ichijou, his plans have crumbled. What happened the other night was an overkill, basically. Kageaki also feels guilt and shame for not being able to stop Ichijou before she murdered Doushin. (remember, he vowed earlier to try and keep her from going berserk) He is also puzzled by the fact that Ichijou survived an injury that would’ve killed any other Musha.</p>
<p><em>Just what sort of person is Ayane Ichijou? Harboring a strong desire for all that is just, despising all that is wicked, a will utterly unmatched and unshakable. In other words…</em></p>
<p><em>She is a hero.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no other way to put it.</em></p>
<p>The current situation is that Raichou is probably shitting his pants thinking we simply used him all along and are actually planning to overthrow the Shogunate. (which isn’t actually true, but this is what it must look like from his viewpoint.) He’s now probably overly suspicious of everyone and has also severed all connections with us.</p>
<p>Prince: The situation is dire… but let me say this, Kageak. You are not at fault here. I was the one who sent you on this mission, so the responsibilty lies with me.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities, Chief concludes: 1) Raichou will continue to co-opreate with us after all. 2) he will view us as a threat and attempt to destroy us. Both of those options are equally probable, he adds. The room falls silent, and the scene ends.</p>
<p>We cut to Ichijou, resting at Kageaki’s house. She feels a sense of accomplishment and pride after defeating Doushin.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero107.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926" title="hero107" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero107.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>Every single person commiting similar evil solely for the sake of evil, just like Doushin, will be thurst deep into the fires of oblivion – I wall make sure of that.</em></p>
<p><em>Father would be proud.</em></p>
<p><em>He would praise me for being such a perfect daughter.</em></p>
<p><em>Just like the time I ki[t4fled--</em></p>
<p><em>--all those years ago...</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero108.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927" title="hero108" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero108.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>I felt dizzy for a few seconds. Must be a slight fever.</em></p>
<p>(That was intentional. The text was gibberish in the original as well. I have a guess as to what it's supposed to symbolize based on previous foreshadowing, but I won't say it here. I'll let you guys speculate on your own for now.)</p>
<p>She then decides to read the newspaper. She looks at the headline:</p>
<p>[The murder of Yusa Doushin]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">MURDER</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero109.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928" title="hero109" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero109.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: ………?</p>
<p><em>My eyes kept staring at that one line. That one word.</em></p>
<p>MURDER</p>
<p><em>I… feel strange.</em></p>
<p><em>Why am I shaking…?</em></p>
<p><em>Surely, the demise of Doushin must be a shocking revelation to the townsfolk of Kamakura, but to me… it’s hardly anything new.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… my hands are trembling.</em></p>
<p><em>It is a truth I’m familiar with – I defeated Yusa Doushin. That’s all there is to it.</em></p>
<p><em>WRONG.</em></p>
<p><em>I vanquished that false priest and threw him into an abyss fit for his own wicked self. That’s all there is to it.</em></p>
<p><em>WRONG.</em></p>
<p><em>YOU DID NOT “DEFEAT” HIM.</em></p>
<p><em>YOU DID NOT “VANQUISH” HIM.</em><br>
<em>…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930" title="hero110" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero110.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>YOU</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>MURDERED</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>A HUMAN BEING</em></p>
<p>Doushin’s final words echo in her mind.</p>
<p>“You are the victor! So laugh, with your head held high! Ridicule the defeated, mock his agony!”</p>
<p><em>Why…? Why has it become hard to breathe all of a sudden…?</em></p>
<p><em>I have done nothing wrong – nothing to be ashamed of.</em></p>
<p><em>I fought evil. Defeated it. And won.</em></p>
<p><em>Father would praise me for it. “You did well!” – he would say.</em></p>
<p><em>I can hear his voice. His voice… from back then.</em></p>
<p><em>The words he uttered… when…</em></p>

<p>“Well done, Ichijou. Just like that.”</p>
<p>Ichijou: M-mi… nato..</p>
<p>Afternoon turns into evening, and Kageaki arrives home. He insatntly notices that there’s something wrong with Ichijou. Upon entering the room, he steps on the newspaper and examines it.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933" title="hero113" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero113.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: *thinking* So, she finally realized it.</p>
<p><em>…that what she did was murder. Up until now, she blocked that thought out of her mind. She clothed it in terms like “justice” or “vanquishing evil”, while the word “murderer” was conveniently pushed aside into her subconscious.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou!</p>
<p><em>I uttered her name in a slightly firmer tone. This time, there was a reaction. A rather sudden one, in fact. When she looked up and saw me there, she jumped up and into my arms.</em></p>
<p><em>She wasn’t crying. There were no traces of tears on her cheeks. However, just by looking at her, it became clear that she was fighting the urge with all her might.</em></p>
<p><em>The moment she breaks down in tears…</em></p>
<p><em>…would signal the end of the individual known as Ayane Ichijou.</em></p>
<p><em>People often say that we should cry when we are sad. Tears temporarily wash away the sadness and allow us to face our difficulties with renewed strength. However, no such rebirth exists for the murderer.</em></p>
<p><em>The sins of the murderer are all in the past. No tears will wash that deed away. Therefore, the tears of the murderer are shed for the sake of her own redemption alone. Forgiveness that only she can grant herself. It is the highest form of cowardice.</em></p>
<p><em>That is why the likes of us are unable to shed tears.</em></p>
<p><em>So, to be able to continue living as Ayane Ichijou, she will not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>There is nothing I can do for her. Holding her in my arms, cradling her trembling shoulders is the only solace I can grant her.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Dammit… why…? Why do I have to be so weak…? I have to be the agent of justice. All those bastards at Rokuhara… I have to k… ki… kill them all…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou…</p>
<p>What is it that holds you back? What binds your hand? I wanted to ask her that. But I couldn’t. It was the one and only thing that still kept her sane.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Please, Minato… tell me! How can you be so strong?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m not strong… at all.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Bullshit. You fight and kill just like me, you are even burdened with a curse, and despite that… you have yet to break down like I have.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Ichijou: I want to be like you! So please… lend me some of your strength… Even if it’s only for this one night…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m afraid treating women gently is not one of my strong points…</p>
<p>Ichijou: I know.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I might end up being violent. Are you really fine with this?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I… hope you will not come to regret this.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I won’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero114.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934" title="hero114" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero114.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>So while he’s kissing her, he recalls the first time he had sex. An image of him having sex with some other woman flashes on the screen, but her face is not shown. I’m not sure if it even matters.</p>
<p>This is all I can show you, but still. This is the same image that came up during the Kanae sex scene, by the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/woman-crp.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915" title="woman-crp" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/woman-crp.png" width="584" height="119"></a></p>
<p>In any case, Kageaki and Ichijou have sex, and he -once again, like in Kanae’s route- turns into a complete man animal. But I suppose that’s just how he is.</p>
<p>Ichijou: You really ended up being as violent as you said…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero116.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936" title="hero116" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero116.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>A bit later:</p>
<p><em>And then, Ichijou revealed it to me – that she had murdered her own father.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: He was the first person I’ve ever looked up to. And the first person I’ve ever killed.</p>
<p><em>She chose such a topic for pillow talk. For a while, I had no answer.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Why did you do it…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Why indeed…</p>
<p><em>She wasn’t trying to evade my question with such a reply. She was genuinely thinking about it.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero117.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937" title="hero117" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero117.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: I, um… I’ve heard about what happened to you. That the curse forced you to kill your own…</p>
<p>Kageaki: So… the Chief told you.</p>
<p><em>I finally understood the fundamental flaw in her personality. Where her strong attachment to “justice’ emerged from.</em></p>
<p><em>She was like me.</em></p>
<p><em>I would rather evade the use of a word like “fate”. And yet, there is no other way to describe our meeting – the chance encounter of two parricides.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato. I’ve decided that I will continue to fight. To murder. To hate the evils of this world. I will not she tears. Nor will I despair. As long as you’re by my side, I…</p>
<p><em>Would things be alright this way? I did not answer her. I could not.</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>The next few scenes are rather lacking in exciting dialogue, so I’ll just sum them up with my own words.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero118.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938" title="hero118" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero118.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>We switch to Raichou, Chachamaru and Shishiku. Raichou is panicking and tells them it was the prince who killed Doushin, and possibly Moriuji as well (he’s just as paranoid as we expected him to be), and that the troops should be mobilized to deal with him. Chachamaru and Shishiku tell him to deal with it on its own, also hinting at the fact that they know about his secret dealings with the prince. Raichou, scared shitless, hurries off.</p>
<p>Chachamaru is rather lenient towards him, so Shishiku asks if she’s ever actually hated Raichou. Chachamaru says no, and declares that she’ll take care of the cleanup after everything’s over. She also concludes that no matter how you look at it, the days of the Rokuhara are numbered, but Shishiku disagrees, saying that as long as he’s alive, the Rokuhara will not be destroyed. In any case, he tells Chachamaru that she can do as she pleases in Kamakura.</p>
<p>We’re back with Chief and the prince, recieving reports of Raichou mobilizing his troops. His objective is clear. Chief suggests that the prince flees Kamakura, but he disagrees and intends to stay, stating that escaping would hurt his pride and is basically equal to dying. Suddenly, an enemy soldier serving under Raichou bursts into the room, intent on assassinating the prince – however, he is quickly dispatched by Ichijou (Kageaki’s also with her).</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero119.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939" title="hero119" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero119.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki is equally shocked upon hearing the news that the prince intends to stay, and that Chief will also remain by his side to die with him. They tell Kageaki and Ichijou that they’ve already helped them more than enough, so they’re free to leave.</p>
<p>Kageaki: But your Highness! Allow me to-</p>
<p>Prince: I forbid it.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your Highness!</p>
<p>Chief: There are still things you must do. The Ginseigou is still out there and only you can stop her.</p>
<p><em>I hanged my head in shame, unable to say anything.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero120.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941" title="hero120" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero120.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Let us go, Minato. …to kill Imagawa Raichou.</p>
<p>Kageaki/Chief/Prince: …….?!</p>
<p>Ichijou: We’ll have to be quick about it. Kill before being killed. Minato… let us crush the Rokuhara together, and rebuild this country anew!</p>
<p>Prince: However, without the Rokuhara, the GHQ still remains as the main occupying force.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Then we’ll drive them out as well!</p>
<p>Prince: Wouldn’t that be tad bit reckless…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: I can do it. I defeated Doushin, who everyone thought was untouchable. I can rid the world of evil! With Masamune as my blade, and Minato by my side… there’s no way I can lose to anyone!</p>
<p>She wasn’t the girl shivering in my arms from yesterday – not anymore. She was born anew. The girl standing before me right now was the agent of justice itself: a true hero.</p>
<p>???: As expected from the legendary Masamune. Hearing those words of yours made all my worries drift away.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942" title="hero121" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero121.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, the prince has been sheltering Sakurako here, who managed to safely escape from Fudaraku with the help of her brother-in-law, Kuronose Douji (see screenshot, guy dressed in all black).</p>
<p>She wishes to join Ichijou in crushing the Rokuhara. They all agree that although their original plan failed, it is now a kill or be killed situation, so they can’t hesitate.</p>
<p>Kageaki is the only one remaining silent.</p>
<p><em>Something’s… wrong. Something here is just not right. Could I be the odd one out? In this room, filled with voices all agreeing in unison?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero122.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943" title="hero122" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero122.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>Ichijou decided to continue her fight, her soul not clouded by doubt any longer. Lady Sakurako, Chief, the prince – they are all the same.</em></p>
<p><em>Only I hesitate.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>No, there is no reason to hesitate. With Ichijou at my side, the curse binds me no more.</em></p>
<p><em>Are things… really fine the way they are now?</em></p>
<p><em>What is this fear that grabbed hold of my heart, even though I’m in the company of allies? Bloodshed will not bring about a perfect utopia, that much I know. However, the Rokuhara cannot be allowed to exist in its current state, either. Our cause is just. We have to continue to fight for that cause. No matter how much evil blood is shed, I will not have to sacrifice an equal amount of innocents any longer.</em></p>
<p><em>Am I really content with such a state of affairs?</em></p>
<p><em>Something is wrong. Something is not right.</em></p>
<p><em>What is it that I am forgetting?</em></p>
<p>“…Kageaki…”</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero123.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944" title="hero123" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero123.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>Whose words am I trying to dig up from the depths of my mind…?</em></p>
<p>“Do you think the battle is over once your opponent stops breathing? It’s not. Quite the opposite, actually.”</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero124.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945" title="hero124" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero124.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Back in the real world, Ichijou and co. decide to call themselves The Army of Masamune and begin their crusade against evil. Kageaki and Muramasa watch them in silence.</p>
<p>We switch to outside the temple, where a mysterious girl (face or character CG not shown) asks a guard if he’s seen a married couple under the name of Arata. He says he knows no one of such name. The girl thanks him nonetheless and goes home.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946" title="hero125" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero125.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>The next day, on their ship, Kageaki is thinking about their operation – the assassination of Imagawa Raichou. He thinks the success rate is rather low, but isn’t really bothered by it – almost like he wants the operation to fail. Before he can conintue with this line of thought, something interrupts him.</p>
<p>Or rather, someone. Ichijou suddenly hugs him from behind.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero126.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947" title="hero126" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero126.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Certain desires in my body might be aroused if you glue yourself to me like that, you know.</p>
<p>Ichijou: B-but it’s broad daylight! And we’re on a ship!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Exactly why I have a problem with it. Who knows what I might do?</p>
<p>Ichijou: You really have no shame, do you?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Not really.</p>
<p>Ichijou: And you sure are confident in that fact.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am. I have no illusions regarding my ability to restrain myself with women, though…</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yeah, I kinda noticed…</p>
<p><em>She let go of me after muttering those words. Or so I thought. This time, she danced in front of me and embraced me once again, slipping under my coat while doing so.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero127.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948" title="hero127" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero127.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: You’re terrible.</p>
<p>He then zips up his coat, completely “trapping” her inside.</p>
<p>Ichijou: You seemed a bit uneasy back there. Don’t worry. As long as we’re together, nothing can stand in our way. We’ll win this fight for sure.</p>
<p><em>I felt the dazzling light of her soul upon mine, pure and untainted. I found it beautiful.</em></p>
<p><em>Why, then…? Why can’t I let myself be enveloped by her radiance?</em></p>
<p>Kageaki still can’t quite stop thinking about Ginseigou. He remembers how he wasn’t able to learn anything about her in Fudaraku. This operation might be another chance for that, he reminds himself.</p>
<p>Kageaki and Ichijou are en route to their destination, Oyomi – it’s still a few kilometres away, though. They decide to get some drinks at a local cafe for the time being.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero128.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949" title="hero128" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero128.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero129.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950" title="hero129" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero129.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>They order Cinnamon Tea, and the lively waitress goes off towards the kitchen. Kageaki turns and takes a good look.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero130.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952" title="hero130" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero130.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Are you seriously staring at her ass…?</p>
<p>Kagekai: Actually, yes, I am. The way it jiggles is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I can’t believe you can say that with a straigth face.</p>
<p>I wasn’t entirely sure what her problem was.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Is she your type, then…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Type…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Your type of girl, you idiot!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I suppose so.</p>
<p>Ichijou: *sob* No shame at all… none! *sob</p>
<p>So anyway, they quick change the subject and start discussing their mission. They conclude that getting closer to their destination will prove to be difficult. The waitress returns, and places their teacups on the table. Kageaki notices how elegantly she placed the cup onto the table. He suddenly grabs the hand of the young waitress, seemingly captivated by how white and silky smooth it was. Ichijou turns bright red.</p>
<p>Waitress: Oh my… you are quite bold, doing such a thing even though you’re with a cutie like her. *gesturing towards Ichijou*</p>
<p>Kageaki: Right now, you’re the one I’m interested in.</p>
<p>Ichijou: MI-NA-TO! WHAT. ARE. YOU. DOING?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953" title="hero131" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero131.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Waitress: What is the meaning of this, mister…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m interested in three things – your hand, your legs, and your eyes.</p>
<p>Waitress: Oh, you must be telling that to every girl you meet.</p>
<p>Kageaki: No, you’re the only one.</p>
<p>Ichijou: W-w-what’s up with your sudden change in character?! To think he’s cheating on me in front of my eyes! And with such a woman!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your hands are lovely. And at the same time, very cold.</p>
<p>Waitress: That’s because I need to help out in the kitchen as well, washing plates and such.</p>
<p>Kageaki: So you help out with the chores in the kitchen… And yet, your skin is so smooth and beautiful – not rough at all. The way you act and carry yourself… is suspiciously calm. You are… vigilant, always ready to for an attack. It is the behaviour of a person who knows the way of the sword. And finally… your gaze was not tainted by suspicion the moment two strangers, who clearly aren’t locals, entered your shop.</p>
<p>The watiress starts acting suspiciously.</p>
<p>Ichijou: *gasping* In other words, she must be…</p>
<p>Kageaki: …a young lady who knows a thing or two about wielding a sword and who only recently started working here as a waitress.</p>
<p>Ichijou: WHAAAAAAAAAT?</p>
<p>Waitress: Th-that’s right!</p>
<p>Okay, so Kageaki isn’t actually serious, and quickly lets the waitress know that he’s onto her. She&nbsp;realizes she has been found out, and leaps backwards. Kageaki stands up and faces her.</p>
<p>Waitress: Hm, I let me guard down by thinking you were just a perverted customer.</p>
<p>So she calls her buddies, all armored and under orders from Raichou. They also bring out a man, a woman and child from the kitchen area, holding them as hostages.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero132.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954" title="hero132" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero132.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Waitress: I think it’s pretty easy to understand where we stand. In other words, what I want… is your lives. Remember that we have three hostages. We can kill at least one of them whenever we want.</p>
<p>Kageaki concludes that he is in deep shit. He wouldn’t mind sacrificing two lives to save three, but at the same time, he doesn’t want Ichijou to die because of him. In addition to that, there’s also the matter of stopping Ginseigou. The waitress mocks them that their only chance is to kill them all at once, but that is impossible. Or so she thinks. Muramasa uses some electromagnetic thingamajig that paralyzes all the soldiers, giving Masamune ample time to kill them all.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero133.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955" title="hero133" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero133.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>With all the enemies dispatched, they then free the three hostages, who are rather confused. Kageaki is not sure how to explain all this to them. Ichijou interrupts.</p>
<p>Ichijou: We’re at war with the Rokuhara.</p>
<p>A simple explanation, and to the point.</p>
<p>Man: W-war?!</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes. A war will soon break out. No, actually… it has already begun. Here in Kantou, and soon, the entire nation. The time will soon come when you’ll have make a decision.</p>
<p>Man: Make… a decision? What will we have to decide, exactly?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Who to side with. Who to fight. Whether or not you want to escape.</p>
<p>Kid: A war?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes.</p>
<p>Kid: With the Rokuhara? Why?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Because they’re the bad guys.</p>
<p>Kid: I know them. They… burned everyone at Osaka. And you want to fight *them*?</p>
<p>Ichijou: That’s right.</p>
<p>Kid: Why?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Because I believe that to be just.</p>
<p>Kid: Aren’t you scared?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Haha, well, you see… there’s this thing called bravery.</p>
<p><em>She pointed at the boy’s chest.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: In there.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero134.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" title="hero134" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero134.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kid: Ah… and as long as you have that, you can fight the bad guys?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Yes. Standing up against those who would use the world as their plaything, creating a brighter tomorrow. That is justice.</p>
<p><em>She utters the words while standing next to the corpses of those she had just slaughtered. There is no regret in her voice. No shame. Nothing.</em></p>
<p>End of the scene.</p>
<p>We cut back to where Chief and the prince is. Chief is gunned down by the Rokuhara, led by Chachamaru. Chachamaru then, instead of killing him, offers the prince the chance to flee and seek aid from the GHQ.</p>
<p>Prince: And what will become of you, should I do that?</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Oh, I’ll most likely fight against the GHQ till the bitter end alongside Shishiku. However, we are bound to fail. There’s not much you can do with a Shogunate that was rejected by its own people. I’ll fight and I’ll die. A new, bright tomorrow will come for the people of Yamato. All’s well that ends well.</p>

<p>The prince is stubborn and wants to stay, content with his own death. Chachamaru is naturally surprised. The prince explains his answer by saying that it’s not fair that Chachamaru gains nothing from letting him go, aside from dying in battle, which isn’t much of a reward, I suppose. He wants to know Chachamaru’s true intentions.</p>
<p>Prince: So tell me. What is it you desire?</p>
<p>Chachamaru: The end of the world.</p>

<p>Prince: ………?!</p>
<p>Chachamaru: I thought it might be a good idea to make use of you, but I suppose I’ll have to come up with something else. Oh well. Good night, sweet prince.</p>
<p>She’s about to strike the prince down, when a gunshot is heard.</p>
<p>Prince: Kikuchi…!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero137.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" title="hero137" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero137.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero138.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960" title="hero138" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero138.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Chief is still alive, somehow – with his last breath, he shoots Chachamaru in the chest. Right in the heart, apparently.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: *cough* To think I would die like this… it almost makes me laugh…</p>
<p>Shen then collapses and dies. A bunch of other soldiers rush into the room and begin firing. The scene ends as dozens of gunshots are heard. I’m fairly certain that both Chief and the prince died.</p>
<p>(Okay, so is anyone else getting really suspicious of Chachamaru’s involvement with the plot? I wonder what it is that she’s really planning, considering she seems to have a certain connection to Ginseigou – remember that in Chapter 3, she was in the company of a woman who looked an awful lot like Hikaru. I didn’t point it out then because at that time I haven’t read Chapter 5 yet and didn’t really know what Hikaru looked like. Her desire to see the world end would coincide with the Ginseigou’s wish to spread death and destruction, so there’s that too. Hopefully this will all be explained sooner or later, most likely in Muramasa’s route.)</p>
<p>We cut back to Kageaki and Ichijou – they’ve finally arrived at the place where they were supposed to fight Raichou. I say supposed to because the place has already been attacked, to their surprise. They dismiss the idea that Sakurako and the others did this, because it would differ from the plan they agreed on, plus there’s no way they could’ve gotten here so fast. Still, the place is full of the corpses of Rokuhara soldiers.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero139.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961" title="hero139" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero139.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Something’s wrong here. Who killed all these people…?</p>
<p>Ichijou: All of these corpses are Rokuhara soldiers. There’s no trace of any enemies. Did they… attack each other for some reason?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero140.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963" title="hero140" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero140.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>(Oh shit. OH SHIT. We all know what THAT means.)</p>
<p>Kageaki is ominously silent for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Kageaki: There are no survivors here. All that’s left in this place is a mountain of corpses. And the Grim Reaper herself.</p>
<p>He then begins running towards the castle’s interior. Muramasa is silent, but she knows very well what this is about. Needless to say, Raichou’s also dead.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Who did this…?!</p>
<p>Kageaki: This should be a familiar sight to you as well. You, too, have witnessed carnage like this once before.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero141.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964" title="hero141" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero141.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>The sight before our eyes was no war fought by men – it was a natural disaster. A raging thunderstorm. A fire spreading far and wide through the wind. A tidal wave that consumes entire coastlines. The wrath of the mountains, a volcano erupting and enveloping the land in fire and death.</em></p>
<p><em>They called her a demon. The harbinger of carnage. The silver star of calamity.</em></p>

<p>Kageaki: Hikaru…!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah, what splendid warriors they were. So fierce, so relentless, fighting and killing each other till the very end. It really was a pleasure to behold.</p>
<p>Hikaru: And even you’re here, Kageaki! This truly turned out to be quite an exciting night. Ah, if only every day could be like this, I would be set free from that demon we call boredom.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru…</p>
<p><em>This thing before me is a monster, nothing more. A witch. A freak of nature. Inhuman. She is no longer the sister I loved.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to kill it.</em></p>
<p>And yet… my lingering feelings got the better of me, and I began to talk.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Will you ever come back to your senses…? Is there no hope?</p>
<p>Hikaru: …..?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Will you ever return to the way you were back then? The way we lived during those days, in that small village?</p>
<p>Hikaru: ………</p>
<p>Kageaki: You’ve lost your sanity. And I couldn’t even stop you. Muramasa’s curse got hold of you… you murdered all those villagers and bandits…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Isn’t that right? But your current mental state is not your fault. There’s no way it could be! Is there truly nothing I could possibly do to heal you of this affliction?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hmm… it seems like you don’t fully understand what is going on here. I am not insane. Nor have I changed at all. I am the same Minato Hikaru I’ve always been.</p>
<p>Kageaki: That is impossible! There is no way a sane person could commit such atrocities!</p>
<p>Kageaki is convinced that there is still a shred of humanity left within her. He thinks that if Hikaru was truly and completely insane, she wouldn’t stop at occasional carnage like this. She would want to destroy the entire country of Yamato. At least that’s what he wants to believe in.</p>
<p>Hikaru: *sigh* You really are quite a troublesome fellow, Kageaki. Oh well. The child knows not how a parent feels…</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Hikaru: The reason I haven’t razed Kantou to the ground yet… is because of you.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Because of… me…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hear me out, Kageaki. I am not insane. You said the curse got a hold of me, and I then massacred all those bandits and villagers. However… there is a fundamental flaw in your reasoning. You see, I haven’t actually killed a single person.</p>
<p>Hikaru: I have no enemies. I harbor no hatred towards anyone. All that I have destroyed was done simply in accordance to the true way of the warrior. Muramasa’s curse binds me not, nor has it ever forced my hand. Do you understand now, Kageaki?</p>
<p>He remains silent.</p>
<p>Hikaru: People act in accordance to their own laws*, each and every one of them competing against one another. Through that rivalry, they aspire to reach the highest of positions, one befitting a king. Such is their ultimate desire.</p>
<p>*(Way of war/way of the sword.)</p>
<p>In other words.. no, it cannot be. The insanity of the people she corrupted is the manifestation of that desire?</p>
<p>Kageaki: How can they wish for such a thing…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: That… is the very significance of my existence. I need to spread my will across the entire land so they can fulfill their desires. But it doesn’t benefit you unless I go slowly, little by little. Because you see… the way of the sword that Mother taught you was a flawed one. If I tried to make you accept my own way all at once, you would no doubt go mad. My Muramasa exists for that purpose.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………..</p>
<p>Hikaru: Well, I think it’s about time. What say you, Kageaki? Are you ready to see the light?</p>
<p><em>She declares that with a voice that is untainted by madness or mocking intent. These are her genuine, true feelings.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero146.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969" title="hero146" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero146.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru. You… are sane. I fully accept that fact.</p>
<p><em>My words were those of acknowledgement. Of parting. A farewell.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: However, your deeds are evil. Which means… that you are my enemy.</p>
<p><em>With those words… I gave up all hope on my own sister.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: It seems like you still don’t quite understand me. Well, I suppose this isn’t such a terrible outcome, either. It is another step towards my own path. I do hope you are prepared to make me your enemy.</p>
<p>Kageaki: …..?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: If you slay me with hatred in your heart, a loved one will have to pay the price. Is there such a person, I wonder…? Are you prepared… to cast away two lives at once? Are you, Kageaki?</p>
<p>Ichijou: He needs no such resolve! For I am here to act in his stead!</p>
<p>She stands in front of Kageaki, protecting him.</p>
<p>Hikaru: And who might you be? Interrupting without properly introducing yourself is quite rude, you know.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I have no name to give you. What I am about to do is all that matters.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hmpf. You are quite the feisty one.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Y-you’re not my mother!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hm… you’re no more than a mad dog, it seems. So, Kageaki! What are *you* planning to do?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Ichijou: I will end you by myself. That’s all there is to it. Is that fine with you, Minato?</p>
<p>Kageaki: …………..</p>
<p>Kageaki: …yes.</p>
<p>Ichijou: It will be fine. Trust me. I’ll be the one to kill her. The only one who dies today is that silver demon!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero147.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970" title="hero147" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero147.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Hikaru: ………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>…………..</p>
<p>…………..<br>
Hikaru: Wait.<br>
Hikaru: What did you just say? Answer me, rabid dog.</p>
<p>Ichjou: Oh, it was clear enough the first time? If Minato is the one who slays you, the curse will force him to sacrifice one other person. However… my Masamune is not chained by such laws! The only one who falls today is you, struck down by the blade of justice! A blade swung by me and Kageaki, together.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Kageaki… is that what you had in mind all along?</p>
<p>I was in agreement with Ichijou. Using Muramasa, two people would have to die. If Masamune is the one who fights, only one person will need to be sacrificed. It was logical. Common sense, even.</p>
<p>And yet… why couldn’t I answer her right away?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Ichijou: Minato…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Y-yes… that is correct.</p>
<p>Ichijou and Hikaru fly into the air, ready to fight.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero149.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972" title="hero149" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero149.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: Die, Ginseigou! Nothing will bring back the people you have murdered. The sword of justice arrived late to take your head. However, I cannot allow you to do as you please any longer! Me and my Masamune – the two of us will stop-</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero150.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974" title="hero150" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero150.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru interrupts her mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Hikaru: You’re making my ears hurt! Shut up already, you lousy dog…!</p>
<p>An explosion is heard, and the screen goes black.</p>
<p><em>I lost consciousness. When I came to, the world itself had changed. All strength was drained from me – like my whole body was withering away.</em></p>
<p><em>Ichijou could not be found anywhere. I tred to order Muramasa to search for her.</em></p>
<p><em>Found her. She’s roughly 4 kilometres to the northeast. In other words… I was blown that far away from them.</em></p>
<p>So he goes back, and this is the sight that welcomes him.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero151.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975" title="hero151" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero151.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>In a world turned <em>completely&nbsp;</em>upside down, her silver visage alone was unchanging. Her gaze pierced me with unprecedented coldness and anger.</em></p>
<p><em>She looked at me… with disappointment.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero152.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976" title="hero152" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero152.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: How foolish. How idiotic. How pathetic… of all things, to resort to such deception and trickery…! Not even Mother’s nonsensical way of thinking was so despicable! It truly is nothing more than lies and deceit. Kageaki… to think you would stoop so low…!</p>
<p><em>All Ichijou and I wanted was to be free from the curse that would force death upon those who do not deserve it. To be able to slay only those branded as evil by her. What is so wrong with that? What is so foolish about such a desire?</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… my brain probably understood in advance what she was trying to point out to me. The very fact that my entire body is shaking right now is due to that realization.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: You are severely mistaken about something, Kageaki. You believed that joining forces with her and having to murder only one person would be “justice”?</p>
<p>Two deaths equal evil?</p>
<p>And one death equals justice?</p>
<p>Is that what you are implying?</p>
<p>Kageaki: You’re wrong! I merely wish to avoid having to kill those who don’t deserve death!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Oh, I see. So killing a sinner is fine. No, let me rephrase that. Letting a sinner be killed… is fine by you.</p>
<p>Kageaki: There exist sins that cannot be forgiven! People who deserve nothing but death! People who are too powerful to be judged by conventional means. People like you or the Rokuhara. I will not believe for a second that there is anything wrong with such a way of thinking.</p>
<p>Hikaru: That might possibly be the right thing to do, indeed. Nonetheless… could such a way of thinking be really called “justice”?</p>
<p>Kageaki: What…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Are you implying that a murderer who kills for a just cause is free from sin?</p>
<p><em>I was at a loss for words.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: So stop saying such foolish things. A murderer is a murderer. End of story. What we’re talking about is merely violence against violence. People murdering other people. He who resorts to brute strength, triumphs and kills. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Sin and innocence are no concern of mine. Whether or not the murderer’s cause is just makes no difference to me. For those who rob others of their lives deserve no differentiation. They are ultimately the same.</p>
<p><em>No reply would escape my lips. For I knew she was right.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… I could not bring myself to accept a single word of what she was saying. It would invalidate everything I’ve done up until now – everything I believed to be true and just. It would mean that she-</em></p>
<p>(He’s talking about Icijiou there.)</p>
<p>Kageaki: Even still… despite all that… Muramasa destroys both those who deserve death, and those who do not!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Look at it this way. Those who deserve death are the weak. Those who do not are the strong. It matters not whether they are evil or good.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You’re wrong! Those deserving death are nothing but villains that should be judged! And yet, while Muramasa judges such evils, it drags innocents down along with them! I cannot possibly forgive such a thing!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Kageaki, Kageaki…</p>
<p><em>The silver demon standing before let out a laugh, too worn out to be angry.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: You’re talking like a child. It seems like you weren’t able to comprehend anything. Murdering both the wicked and the just – “The counterbalance of good and evil” – until the very end, you gravely misunderstood the true meaning behind that phrase, which is the very essence of Muramasa.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I… misunderstood it…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: It is no curse. It is merely… the truth. The very thing that all those who wield a sword are bound by.</p>
<p>Kageaki: What… do you mean by that?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero153.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977" title="hero153" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero153.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: You wouldn’t understand even if I told you. Not in your current state. Still, I’ll tell you this much. You think your alliance with that girl results in “justice”? No. All it results in… is murder.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hikaru: You talk of sin and punishment and justice… in reality, all you’re doing is pushing the burden of taking someone’s life onto that girl! Have you no shame, Kageaki?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: You are pathetic. Almost painful to look at. You have drifted far from the true path of the warrior.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Hikaru: You’ve learned nothing. It seems like I’ve spoiled you too much… and my plans backfired. And now… behold! I will spread violence all across this land! Let the world bear witness to the truth I embody!</p>
<p><em>Uttering those words, the silver demon flied off into the sunset. All I could do was gaze at her fading visage, unable to move my limbs.</em></p>
<p><em>Not a single drop of energy remained in my broken soul.</em></p>
<p><em>And then… the world itself came to an end.</em></p>
<p>We’re shown that the entire land of Yamato is slowly being engulfed by Ginseigou’s corruption, and people start killing each other pretty much all across the nation.</p>

<p>We’re then back with Kageaki and Ichijou, who are looking at all the chaos around them in horror.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero158.jpg"><img title="hero158" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero158.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki deeply ponders Hikaru’s words, and has second thoughts about letting Ichijou do all the killing for him. They temporarily decide to stay in some abandoned shack.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero159.jpg"><img title="hero159" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero159.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Kageak then has a dream of sorts, waking up in his workplace from Chpater 5.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero160.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" title="hero160" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero160.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>

<p>He goes home and is greeted by Subaru. We then jump ahead. Waaay ahead, to the end of the chapter. We’re back at the moment when Subaru is about to be killed by Mizuhi’s younger brother. Kageaki wants to save her, but is reluctant to use Muramasa… except, the Tsurugi that is in front of him right now is Masamune, not Muramasa.</p>
<p><em>“Did it… really happen that way…?”</em></p>
<p>Masamune: Hurry up, Midou! Say the words! Your mother’s life is at stake!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Meet a demon… slay the demon. Meet a saint…</p>
<p>Kageaki: …….?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero162.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-986" title="hero162" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero162.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>No, that is not right. Something’s wrong here.</em></p>
<p>Masamune: Are you out of your mind? Who taught you such useless words?!</p>
<p>Masamune: I am the agent of justice! The devil’s heart is what I pierce! Evil is what I vanquish! Only the wicked fall before my blade – that is what you must vow!</p>
<p><em>“Only… the wicked?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is that… really how it is?”</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: As long as the devil lives, my blade shall pierce its heart. As long as evil persists, my steel shall know the taint of blood. Therein lies… the way… of the sword…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" title="hero163" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero163.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Masamune: Hmpf, I see that you are hesitant, but I’ll accept it all the same. Let us go now, Midou, to smite evil!</p>
<p>Kageaki is amazed by Masamune’s power, and drunk on the idea of “justice”. He’s all “fuck yeah let’s fuck some evil-doers up” and charges at the enemy. Before he can strike down the boy, though, he glances towards Subaru for a moment, which makes him hesitate.</p>
<p><em>“Wait.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What was my mother saying…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Don’t kill anyone. Not even a single person.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That is correct. But… can I really save her by adhering to that rule?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No. I cannot.”</em></p>
<p><em>” Should you end up dying, I will find the ones responsible and kill them all. Without leaving a single survivor.”</em></p>
<p><em>She was right. The moment I kill him, someone, somewhere, will come to detest me. Pursuing the path I believe to be “justice”, I would kill an enemy before me. For someone out there, however, that very enemy could’ve been a manifestation of their own concept of justice. In other words, I would become evil in the eyes of such a person.</em></p>
<p><em>Justice transforms into evil, twisted into its exact opposite.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>Such is the counterbalance of good and evil.</em></p>
<p><em>I engrave that truth onto my very soul.</em></p>
<p><em>I killed him. What was his name…?</em></p>
<p><em>*image of Ouji Suguru flashes on the screen*</em></p>
<p><em>It doesn’t matter. The moment I killed him, I acted upon my own idea of justice.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero164.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="hero164" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero164.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Miaso: Father…!</p>
<p><em>She was his daughter. In her heart, at that moment, a new-found hatred was born. Hatred for me. In her eyes, I was undeniably evil.</em></p>
<p>Miaso: I’ll never forgive you. Never…!!</p>
<p><em>Her hatred was completely justified. Following my own concept of justice, I trampled upon others’.</em></p>
<p><em>A man once told me that I was no hero, because heroes take pride in their kills. He told me I was no villain, because villains take the life of another with a smile on their face.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero165.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="hero165" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero165.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>Those who kill for their own sake are evil. Those who massacre others while labeling themselves heroes are equally evil.</em></p>
<p><em>Those who take the life of another… are all, without exception, evil.</em></p>
<p><em>I unconsciously believed in the existence of such concepts as good and evil.</em></p>
<p><em>Why did I believe in that? The reason… is this.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero166.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990" title="hero166" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero166.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>Minato Kageaki’s greatest sin.</em></p>
<p><em>I went on to kill and kill over and over again. Firmly believing those deeds to be evil, its exact opposite was also born within my heart. Killing my mother was evil – punishing that deed would be justice. Even now, I believe in that. However, there was something I did not fully understand.</em></p>
<p><em>I did not consider the existence of other forms of evil, of other forms of justice.</em></p>
<p><em>I did not consider the possibility that those who act in the name of justice might not be free from sin and evil themselves.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Kageaki wakes up and realizes that he must follow his own path – a path different from Ichijou’s. He concludes that he will need to defeat Ginseigou by himself. He also realizes that this will result in him killing Ichijou as well.</p>
<p>Kageaki: If evil is slain, good will inevitably fall as well. That is the curse cast upon all those who wield a sword. For a single life is a mixture of both good and evil. One’s enemy is another’s ally. One’s wickedness is another’s virtue. The moment a sword takes a life, it slays both evil and good at the same time, without fail – without exceptions. There exists no blade that strikes down only the wicked. There is no steel that tastes the blood of villains alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero167.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991" title="hero167" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero167.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>In other words – every single weapon forged within this world bears the curse that is Muramasa.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: He who fears the loss of comrades lacks the resolve to kill his enemy. There is no difference between the death of an enemy and an ally. One must not differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>Kageaki: That is what it means to have the resolve to slay both the wicked and the just.</p>
<p>That is the one and only truth of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa. Let us go. I will need you to lend me all of your power.</p>
<p>Muramasa: As you wish, my master.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero168.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992" title="hero168" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero168.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Meet a demon – slay the demon. Meet a saint – slay the saint. Therein lies… the way of the sword!</p>
<p><em>As legend tells it, Masamune and Muramasa were training under the same master as blacksmiths. One day, their master ordered them to lower their blades into the river. In the end, he praised Masamune, whose sword left all of the leaves untouched, saying that a blade must cut only what it needs to cut.</em></p>
<p><em>However… one has to wonder – whose sword reflected better the true nature of war?<br>
</em></p>
<p>He then flies off and confronts Hikaru, admitting to her that she was right.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero169.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993" title="hero169" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero169.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: The death of both evil and good is the inevitable fate of the warrior. I have finally understood that.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah…! Wonderful! You’ve finally opened your eyes to reality! Let us dance together, then, my beloved Kageaki. I welcome you with open arms! Let us spread chaos across the land, conquering the world itself, ascending to the heavens!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I will have to refuse. You crushed my delusions – now it is time for me to crush yours. Your crimson-tainted nightmare ends here, Ginseigou…!</p>
<p>So in a nuthsell, Kageaki gets fucked up by Hikaru. He then crashes onto the ground.</p>
<p><em>I believe I can still recall those bygone days of joy and happiness.</em></p>
<p><em>Days from a distant, distant past…</em></p>
<p><em>Everything I could ever want was within my reach.</em></p>
<p><em>Long, long ago…</em></p>
<p><em>“Tell me the tales that to me were so dear</em><br>
<em>Sing me the songs I delighted to hear”</em><br>
<em>I had a mother and a sister. I had a family.</em></p>
<p><em>We were connected by the deep bond of love and affection.</em></p>
<p><em>Long, long ago…</em></p>
<p><em>“Now, you are come, all my grief is removed.</em><br>
<em>Let me forget that so long you have rov’d</em><br>
<em>Let me believe that you love as you lov’d”</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Unless you long for me, and only me, you won’t be able to touch me! Discard all that is unnecessary. Think of me, and only me!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero170.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995" title="hero170" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero170.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>I can still recall that lovely sight.</em></p>
<p><em>From so long ago…</em></p>
<p><em>Those idle, yet unforgettable days.</em></p>
<p><em>When we still had each other. When we were still a family.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you remember the path where we met?</em><br>
<em>Ah, yes, you told me you ne’er would forget</em><br>
<em>Then to all others my smile you preferr’d</em></p>
<p><em>“Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word</em><br>
<em>Still my heart treasures the praises I heard”</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah, I see. No matter what you do, you are chained down by that… falsity. That fabrication. It is a deception, no more.</p>
<p><em>I still remember it – kindness that knew no bounds.</em></p>
<p><em>Happiness that cannot be put into words.</em></p>
<p><em>“Though by your kindness my fond hopes were rais’d</em><br>
<em>You by more eloquent lips have been prais’d”</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: We both murdered her, Kageaki. You killed her – while I let her die.&nbsp;Our mother.</p>
<p><em>Not even time itself can erase the joy I feel in my heart.</em></p>
<p><em>That is what I used to believe.</em></p>
<p><em>“But by long absence your truth has been tried</em><br>
<em>Still to your accents I listen with pride”</em></p>
<p>(While this little poem goes on, we get flashbacks of Kageaki’s hometown and his house.)<br>
Kageaki: What…?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Yes. I let you kill her. Your own mother. Two years ago… even before Muramasa was released… I already knew. I knew what that Tsurugi really longed for. What would happen if its blade would strke someone down. I knew all of it – that the life of an enemy would have to be paid for with the life of an ally. That hatred is the price to pay for love.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero172.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997" title="hero172" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero172.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Hikaru: That is why I did not kill the bandit leader’s younger brother. I sent him flying right to you. All so that you would have to rely on Muramasa’s power. So that you would be tarpped by its curse.</p>
<p>Hikaru: So that you would kill Mother.</p>
<p>Hikaru: So, you see… we are both responsible for her death. Through you, I killed my sworn enemy, and the world itself. But all of that is in the past. Nothing but an illusion of days gone by. So forget all of it. Look only at me. Fix your gaze only upon me!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Your mother is dead. If you would still cling onto her, unable to forget… in that case, I will become your mother in her stead. So come to me – your place is at my side. All you need in this world is me!</p>
<p>Kageaki: HIKARU…!!</p>
<p>He compltetely loses it and goes berserk.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Come… Kageaki! Only a little more… just a bit more… and you will be able to reach me!</p>

<p>So Kageaki goes into rage mode and Falcon Punches Hikaru into oblivion.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah.. haha… it’s been fun, Kageaki. Let us meet again… in another time, another place…</p>
<p>She then falls to her death, while Kageaki lands on the ground.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Should I confirm if she…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: No need…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero178.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003" title="hero178" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero178.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>I knew that the moment I would fully realize what I had just done… my heart, completely paralyzed and unfeeling up until now, would break.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou lands behind her.</p>
<p><em>She fully understood what I had done, and gazed at me in silence – a silence that said more than any words possibly could.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero179.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004" title="hero179" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero179.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: The anger you feel towards evil is justified. Your hatred as well. However, your struggle, the way you fight… is something I cannot approve of.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Wh-what are you talking about…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I had to be the one to face Ginseigou. If she was defeated by someone who saw her as nothing more than a monster, her defeat would have become equivalent to “justice”, with the cruel truth of the battlefield all but forgotten and discarded. She had to be defeated by someone… who realized that she, too, used to be human. So that the sin of killing her would not be twisted into something called justice.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I can’t understand a word of what you’re saying…! B-but, if you kill someone as Muramasa…</p>
<p>Kageaki: …I’ll have to kill someone else as well. I know.</p>
<p>So he basically explains to her the same thing he realized after having that dream.</p>
<p>Kageaki: So fight me, then. Fight me knowing the fundamental contradiction, the harsh reality of the battlefield. Your hands are already tainted with blood. It is a fact that cannot be changed, a truth you cannot flee from.</p>
<p>Ichijou: &nbsp;I will never accept that! If what you’re saying is true… that would mean there is no such thing in this world as justice!</p>
<p>Kageaki: If “justice” meant a fixed and unchanging set of values, then you would be correct. However, no such thing exists.</p>
<p>Ichijou: N-no! Father had taught me all of it. One must not rob others of what is dear to them. One must not oppress others. One must refuse evil, and live with a pure heart! That is the justice we humans can believe in!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Morals…? Ethics…? It is simply what the majority believes to be just. It is no absolute truth.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Y-you’re wrong…! You’re…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your strong belief, and desire to oppose evil… I believe it is something to be treasured. However, you have no right to label it as “justice”. That way, you will eventually lose sight of the very essence of who you really are – a murderer.</p>
<p>He basically tells her that they way she is right now, she might end up becoming the next Ginseigou, killing others because she believes it to be a just cause.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Promise me that you will never call your own cause “justice”. If you do that, I will let you have my head, free of any lingering regrets.</p>
<p>Ichijou: N-no! I refuse! Vanquishing evil, carrying out justice – if I hide that, I will never be able to make this world right! I will have brought shame upon Father! I… I… am Ayane Ichijou! I cannot possibly change that!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I see. In that case, I will continue to exist as Muramasa – in order to expose the hypocrisy that governs the battlefield. And I will have to defeat you.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero180.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006" title="hero180" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero180.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: You betrayed me…!!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Prepare yourself.</p>
<p><em>Denial. Betrayal. That was the only answer Minato Kageaki had for Ayane Ichijou.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: The only way to defeat the likes of the Rokuhara is to answer their violence with violence of our own!</p>
<p>Kageaki: You are correct.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero181.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007" title="hero181" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero181.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>*shouting at the same time* Kageaki: However! Ichijou: Therefore!</p>
<p>*shouting at the same time* Kageaki: That is everything but justice! Ichijou: That *is* justice!</p>
<p>So they fight and argue for a bit, mostly about things we’ve already covered.</p>
<p>Then Kageaki thinks it’s time to settle things.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero182.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008" title="hero182" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero182.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I am the Full Metal Daemon – Muramasa. He who brings to light the very truth that governs the battlefield. I am the one people fear in the night, the one they detest from the bottom of their hearts. For good and evil both fall prey to my hungering blade.</p>
<p>Ichijou uses Masamune’s ultimate power (see screenshot), and ends up defeating Kageaki.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero183.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009" title="hero183" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero183.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>He doesn’t die, though. Masamune suggests following him to the crash site, but Ichijou is distracted by a nearby commotion – the Rokuhara pillaging a small village. She wants to interfere, but before she can don Masamune, she is shot by someone.</p>
<p>That someone is the young boy (Yoshikiyo, I actually did make a note of his name in case he appeared again) who was in the service of Yusa Doushin. At least I think it’s a boy, I don’t recall how the game addressed him, although he has a female voice actor. Previously he appeared for like 2 seconds during the route, therefore I never took a screenshot of him, nor did I bother to mention him. He was the one who handed the bowl of sake to Sakurako (before she was raped), and that’s pretty much all he did in the story up until now.</p>
<p>Yoshikiyo: Oh, you don’t know me? Of course you don’t. But I remember you. I remember you very well…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero184.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010" title="hero184" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero184.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>So basically, he is pissed at Ichijou for killing Doushin. He is rambling like a crazy person, and Ichijou is not sure what to make of him.</p>
<p>Masamune: Who is this…? He talks madness, Midou!</p>
<p>Ichijou: He was… she was the servant of Yusa Doushin.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero185.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011" title="hero185" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero185.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>He then puts on her crazy face. See screenshot.</p>
<p>Yoshikiyo: Ah, I’m so glad you remembered me! It would’ve been too sad for words to imagine what would’ve happened if no one recognized me!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero186.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012" title="hero186" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero186.jpg" width="584" height="321"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou is having a hard time answering due to the bullet wound in her stomach.</p>
<p>Masamune: So, you have come to avenge your master?</p>
<p>Yoshikiyo: Vengenance…? I haven’t really thought that far ahead…</p>
<p>Masamune: What…?</p>
<p>Y: Well… I desperately wanted to meet you, and haven’t really thought of anything else… I wanted to meet the person who did this to me! I wanted to look in her face, see her up close, stand next to her…!</p>
<p>Masamune then pretty much laughs and shouts at him that Doushin deserved his death for all the sins he had commited, and that villains don’t deserve to be avenged.</p>
<p>Y: Ahahahaha! See this? This is the punishment you talk of! THIS!</p>
<p><em>He then threw the small bloody bundle that he’s been carrying towards me. Its contents scattered in the wind. It seemed to be in a liquid-like state, with certain solid parts floating in it… one of the solid lumps hit me in the face. I touched it. It was white… and tender. Once I applied a bit of force to it, it seemed to melt in my hands. What could this be? If I put some thought into it, I could easily figure it out. But I don’t want to. I don’t want to know.</em></p>

<p>Y: Ahahaha… you see… that is my nephew.</p>
<p>He reveals that the girl he is carrying on his shoulder was her sister, who basically acted as Doushin’s mistress/whore. She was also pregnant with his child.</p>
<p>Y: When my sister saw what became of Lord Doushin, cut up to tiny pieces by your blade, she couldn’t bear it. She snapped. And one day, she threw herself down a staircase, even though she was in the last month of pregnancy! Ahahahaha! AND THIS IS THE RESULT! What did you call it again? Divine punishment? You’re saying we deserved this… because Lord Doushin did something bad?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero188.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014" title="hero188" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero188.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Y: But I just don’t get it. My sister didn’t do anything wrong. How exactly did she and the baby deserve your “judgement”? How do you justify murdering someone who hasn’t even been born yet? How? How indeed… But… none of that matters anymore, now does it? You’ve already robbed me of everything… Everything…</p>
<p>(So the bundle in his arms was the stillborn baby. Now re-read that previous part about a certain bloody lump hitting Ichijou in the face, and prepare to projectile vomit.)</p>
<p><em>The piece of meat that hit me earlier now came in contact with my mouth. My ears were filled with the young boy’s laughter, his dead, half-rotten sister gazing at me with lifeless eyes, her unborn child’s flesh kissing my lips.</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder what this taste is.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the taste of sin.</em></p>
<p><em>The sin of one who committed the crime known as “justice”.</em></p>
<p>Then we get an insanely long narration about how Ichijou’s father died. He was basically working for a company dealing with money/taxes and stuff. As such, he was always striving to be fair. As it turns out, he was the only one who felt like this, and was even ridiculed by his co-workers. Long story short, he came across an incident that led him to realize the fundamental contradiction in his ways. Basically, one of his friends did something that had both a good and a bad outcome. He wanted to help out a an empoverished village, but was using illegal means to do so, or something like this. Sorry, this part might not be super accurate because I was reading it late at night and only skimmed through it due to being really tired, but as far as I remember he basically reported his friend (because that’s the right thing to do, aka justice) and then saved the village using his own money. However, no one knew it was him who helped the village. His friend even accused him of being a traitor or something like that. In any case, he performed seppuku out of shame and made Ichijou deliver the finishing blow.</p>
<p>(If you’re wondering why Ichijou was needed: when someone is performing seppuku, there’s usually another person, his second, standing over him to decapitate him once he opened his abdomen. It’s just how the ritual goes. Look it up on Wikipeda if you’re interested in more details.)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero189.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015" title="hero189" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero189.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>He then pulls his own intestines out from the wound, and shows them to Ichijou:</p>
<p>Ichidou: Look at this. Look very closely. This… is evil. This is sin. “Justice” means labeling your opponent as evil – in the end, the justice I have been clinging onto all my life, has turned into evil. However, I have no regrets! If I myself am evil – then my own self is something I cannot possibly allow to exist.</p>
<p>Ichidou: Ichijou. No matter what sort of life you will end up leading, make sure it is something you have decided for yourself. Now… this is my final lesson to you:</p>
<p><em>Detest evil! Without exception!</em></p>
<p><em>Detest the sins I have commited.</em></p>
<p><em>Detest the evil I have embraced.</em></p>
<p><em>Hate me.</em></p>
<p><em>Kill me.</em></p>
<p><em>That which runs counter to the very nature of humans is evil.</em></p>
<p><em>The force that punishes that evil… is justice.</em></p>
<p><em>Ichijou…! Carry out justice! Kill me!</em></p>
<p>She then decapitates her father.</p>
<p><em>Father’s severed head did not roll away. It stood upright, still gazing into my eyes. I rememberd the final thing he had told me.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero190.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1017" title="hero190" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero190.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>“Those who pursue justice are sinners.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This is an inescapable truth. No blade that is swung in the name of justice shall remain clean of blood.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Vanquishing evil through “justice” means discarding that very concept.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Such is the counterbalance of good and evil.”</em></p>
<p>We’re back to the present, where Yoshikiyo continues to ramble on and on about the sort of person Dosuhin was. Despite being a slave to his lust and doing things that could be considered evil, he also raised him and her sister who had previously lost both of their parents. Despite all the bad things he might have done, he was always kind to them, he declares.</p>
<p>Y: Well, this is what you wanted to know, didn’t you? You wanted to hear what sort of person Lord Doushin was, didn’t you? So what’s wrong? Cat got your tongue? Even though a minute ago, you were preaching about the greatness of justice?!</p>
<p>Masamune: Impossible… to think that a pregnant woman… and even her child…</p>
<p>Masamune is at a loss for words, probably for the first time in the entire game. He is utterly disgusted by the fact that he caused the death of a pregnant woman – a deed he associates with those who invaded Yamato all those years ago, the very people he was created to hate and oppose.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" title="hero191" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero191.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Y: What’s wrong, Tsurugi?! You seem like you’re ready to fall apart. I wonder why? Even though your brilliant indigo blue steel looks magnificent when it blends in with the deep crimson of an unborn child’s blood…!</p>
<p>Masamune: Ah… AHHHHHHHHHHH…!!</p>
<p><em>I tasted the blood and flesh still in my mouth.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: So this is the true face of justice. I never knew it was so far from goodness, so filled to the brim with corruption and decay. Not a single ray of light brightens such a path – for it is governed by a darkness that knows no bounds.</p>
<p><em>Channeling my remaining strength into my legs, I stood up.</em></p>
<p>Y: Good, very good. That’s how a true hero should act. You cannot allow yourself to collapse in front of the minions of evil.</p>
<p>Ichijou is about to take off.</p>
<p>Y: Where are you going? Are you planning to let me get away? Are you not going to kill me…?!</p>
<p>Ichijou: I’m sorry… I’m in a hurry…</p>
<p>Y: Don’t fuck around with me! If you aren’t even going to finish what you’ve started… then why did you murder Lord Doushin?! Why did you murder my sister?!</p>
<p>He unloads all her remaining bullets into Ichijou.</p>
<p>Y: Dammit…</p>
<p>I: Forgive me… Your hatred towards me is understandable. I did something unforgivable to you.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Masamune. This is the true nature of “justice”, is it not? Unable to be acknowledged by anyone. Unable to bring happiness to anyone. Hated by everyone. Creating nothing but sorrow and grief.</p>

<p>Masamune: I beg of you… answer me, my master! Has everything I’ve believed in been nothing but a lie? Is there truly no justice to be found in this world?!</p>
<p>Ichijou: No – justice *does* exist!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero193.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020" title="hero193" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero193.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>We cut back to a ruined village, where GHQ soldiers are killing unarmed civilians while singing God Save the Queen. A child (the one who was taken hostage in the cafe) throws a rock at one of the soldiers, yelling at them to give him back his parents. The soldier’s finger slips due to the thrown rock, and accidentally shoots the boy dead. Kageaki later enters the scene and discovers that the boy is the same one from the cafe.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero194.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021" title="hero194" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero194.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>[flashback]</p>
<p>Kid: Aren’t you scared?</p>
<p>Ichijou: Haha, well, you see… there’s this thing called bravery.</p>
<p>Ichijou: In there.</p>
<p>[flashback end]</p>
<p>He can’t quite understand why the boy didn’t just run away, but then he remembers what Ichijou told him and realizes that he might’ve gotten the idea to always fight back from her.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa. Can you locate Masamune?</p>
<p>Muramasa: But Midou, in your current physical condition, you…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I know this much: if I collapse now, I’m never getting back up. Ever. And there is one last thing I have to take care of. I need to defeat Ayane Ichijou.</p>
<p>We cut to Ichijou, who meets up with Sakurako and her brother. She informs Ichijou of the current political status: there’s chaos everywhere, the GHQ is invading, the Rokuhara is pillaging, and so on. She realizes that she also had a hand in starting all this, by forming her little anti-Rokuhara justice leage. She also realizes that many people will die and have already died because of her.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero195.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022" title="hero195" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero195.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Ichijou: However, this doesn’t change anything. We continue what we have started. If the GHQ invades, we’ll drive them out! If the Rokuhara attacks, we’ll take them on! Yamato’s enemies are my enemies!</p>
<p>Ichijou: However, I still have one more thing I have to do.</p>
<p>She then looks at the hairpin she got from Kageaki. Unable to let go of her feeling for Kageaki, but at the same time realizing that she needs to say her goodbyes, she does… well this:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero196.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023" title="hero196" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero196.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>She bites on the round part of the hair ornament, chewing it to pieces and swallowing it. It basically symbolizes her parting with Kageaki, but at the same time her desire to keep his memory within her.</p>
<p>She then flies off to meet Kageaki for their final showdown.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero197.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024" title="hero197" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero197.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>[Background music durnig the scene: Uzuki by VERTUEUX - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8cEueHSZr4">click here</a> to listen to it]</p>
<p>I recorded and subbed the entire upcoming scene on Youtube, right up till the end, but before the epilogue:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="584" height="359" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/fahg7ulnFWI.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></span>
<p>Kageaki: Look – there lay the lifeless body of a child. Do you remember him? He is the boy we met at that cafe, the one to whom you told tales of heroism and justice. He bravely threw a rock at the GHQ soldier who shot both of his parents, without truly understanding what such bravery meant. The result should be obvious – he was killed.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou. I will say this one last time. I will not forbid you from fighting for a just<br>
cause. However, using an attractive word like “justice” to glorify the bloodshed you cause is something I cannot overlook. In order to prevent the harsh reality of the battlefield from being forgotten and discarded – so that violence will not beget even more violence</p>
<p>.<br>
Ichijou: I cannot deny the truth of your words. The battlefield is merely a place for men fight to kill each other – it&nbsp;truly is miserable. It does not deserve to be called justice. Insisting that your cause if just, and&nbsp;involving other people in your fight is unforgivable – truly, evil of the highest magnitude.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………….</p>
<p>Ichijou: Nonetheless… I will fight while carrying the banner of justice, vanquishing all evil that stands in my way! I firmly believe that my path can lead us to a better tomorrow – a world without conflict!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Meet a demon – slay the demon. Meet a saint – slay the saint.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero198.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025" title="hero198" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero198.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p><em>There was once a Tsurugi called Muramasa, of deep crimson. Detesting violence that brought needless death and destruction upon people , she vowed to expose the cruel nature of war.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: As long as the devil lives, my blade shall pierce its heart. As long as evil persists, my steel shall know the taint of blood.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero199.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026" title="hero199" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero199.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>There was once a Tsurugi called Masamune, of magnificent indigo blue. He despised the very evil that would sacrifice the lives of innocents. Therefore, he vowed to give birth to a power that would judge such evil – justice.</em></p>
<p>*shouting at the same time* Therein lies… the way of the sword!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero200.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" title="hero200" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero200.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>There were once two Tsurugi called Muramasa and Masamune. What both of them desired… was a bright world where only peace would reign.</em></p>
<p>Yoshikiyo looks up at the sky where the two of them are battling it out.</p>
<p>Yoshikiyo: Crimson… and indigo…</p>
<p>Douji: Sakurako, look…!</p>
<p>Sakurako: Why are they fighting…?</p>
<p>Sorimachi also gazes at the sky in silence, seemingly unable to believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Kageaki – <em>I finally understood. What she believes in is the fundamental good of humanity – “justice” they create themselves. Like a child -innocent, pure and untainted- she longs for that ideal from the bottom of her heart.</em></p>
<p><em>That is what I believe.</em></p>
<p><em>That is what I have come to comprehend.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou -&nbsp;<em>He simply wants to prevent me from becoming the next Ginseigou. I understood that. Were his fears misguided? No. Not at all. By fighting for my own beliefs and wielding the blade of justice, I might very well become an entity that sows the seeds of senseless conflict across the world – a new silver demon.</em></p>
<p><em>That is what I believe.</em></p>
<p><em>That is what I have come to comprehend.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/extra-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1219" title="extra 1" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/extra-1.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I fully understand what she is fighting for. I accept her ideals as noble and sympathize with her cause.</p>
<p>Ichijou: I fully understand why he wants to stop me. I truly comprehend the weight of his words.</p>
<p><em>What we long for, what we strive for is one and the same. I truly understand that! So why are we fated to cross blades?</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Temperature dropping! Midou! Using up any more energy will endanger your life!</p>
<p>Kageaki<em> – My body, after receiving one terrible blow after the other, is now on the verge of complete breakdown. My senses have already crossed the boundaries of sanity – my entire being is drowned in sensations akin to the mass of a tremendous rock weighing down on my soul; fatigue beyond fatigue.</em></p>
<p><em>Crippling pain and anguish. I am mere seconds away from succumbing to the call of dreams. I have already fought my share of battles.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… a single, burning reason prevents me from surrendering. Even though I do comprehend and respect her views and actions.</em></p>
<p><em>My reason to continue this fight is…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/extra-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1218" title="extra 2" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/extra-2.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa – my very own Tsurugi. Please, lend me your strength for just a little longer.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Understood. I will become your loyal blade for as long as you wish.</p>
<p>Masamune: Your bullet wound from before has opened up once again. Midou! Unless you want your life to be in danger, we have to retreat and close that wound!</p>
<p>Ichijou<em> – My gunshot wound, already treated with emergency measures once before, has opened once again, wider and more lethal than ever. I can sense my very life draining away with every drop of blood I lose, second by second.</em></p>
<p><em>Violent pain and nausea. The fearfully real sensation of imminent death. I am mere seconds away from succumbing to the call of dreams. I have already fought my share of battles.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… a single, burning reason prevents me from surrendering. Even though I do comprehend and respect his views and actions.</em></p>
<p><em>My reason to continue this fight is…</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Enough of your cowardly nonsense, Masamune! You think I’d die from a wound like that? Patch it up with shit for all I care, we’re moving forward! That’s what my Tsurugi would do!</p>
<p>Ichijou: I’ll grit my teeth and bear it! Masamune – lend me your strength!</p>
<p>Masamune: As you wish!</p>
<p><em>Our desires are one and the same – and yet, the paths we tread on are opposites.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: The one I challenge is evil itself – for it is the source of all conflict.</p>
<p>Kageaki: The one I challenge is justice itself – for it is the source of all conflict.</p>
<p>Ichijou: Daemon, your end is nigh!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Justice, your end is nigh!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1217" title="extra 3" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/extra-3.jpg" width="584" height="325"></p>
<p><em>In order to decrease, even if only by a little amount, the suffering within this world – we fight. As old rivals. As loyal comrades.</em></p>
<p><em>We fight, plunging onto the opposite paths we have chosen for ourselves…</em></p>
<p><em>…yet chasing after the same dream.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou!<br>
<em>There was no need to listen to what the Tsurugi was about to say, for I knew it all too well, felt it on my own skin.</em></p>
<p><em>I was falling apart – the balance of power, that terrible scale, would slowly but surely tip in the enemy’s favor… and spell my doom.</em></p>
<p><em>Muramasa’s power was not faltering. My own flesh, blood and bones – the very sparkle of my life – was compressed into this moment and summoned forth to maintain the unimaginable heights of power required to continue our dance.</em></p>
<p><em>Masamune was on another level, going beyond the maintenance of such unimaginable power, following up one terrible strike with an even stronger one, and then yet another one.</em></p>
<p><em>Fierce strength, powerful beyond imagination – and so, Ayane Ichijou became a a warrior that can only be referred to as a true hero.</em></p>
<p><em>The hero falters not, and is bound to prevail. She pushes herself to the limit, becoming stronger and stronger, step by step. All in order to obtain power necessary the slay her enemy – and in the end, she will gain that power.</em></p>
<p><em>At this rate, I shall be defeated. I shall fade into nothingness, along with my admiration for her power.</em></p>
<p><em>At this rate, I shall be defeated. And yet, my soul is that of the warrior; from the depths of that consciousness, begins to take form a solution to break through this deadlock.</em></p>
<p><em>There had always been but one single way for a turnabout – to settle this once and for all.</em></p>
<p><em>If the enemy proceeds to gain momentum at this rate, she will eventually arrive at heights I cannot possibly reach. But I need not follow her there, or maintain that power as she does: all I actually need is one moment. A single strike that carries the weight of my entire being. A strike of certain death, of absolute destruction: a blade of thunder carrying my very soul – the lightning steel that shall put a period at the end of our tale.</em></p>
<p><em>No. I cannot emergy victorious like that.</em></p>
<p><em>Masamune’s most powerful technique relies on absorbing his enemy’s very own energy, and turning that power back on its user: “Karmic Justice – Divine Retribution”. A skill that answers the enemy’s own technique with an absolute, heavenly decree. The inescapable, unavoidable judgement of the divines.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero201.jpg"><img title="hero201" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero201.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>I had tasted its power first hand once before. The sole reason I did not perish then and there was due to the insufficient power I poured into my own attack.</em></p>
<p><em>If I launch a technique that is certain to kill, the same unavoidable death shall be directed back towards myself. Fierce and indisciminate justice, without the faintest hint of of falsity.</em></p>
<p><em>Drawing my electromagnetic blade will inevitably spell my own doom. However, not relying on it will lead to the same outcome. </em></p>
<p><em>How to proceed? What else can I rely on to fell such a hero? An opponent I am unable to topple, even with pouring all I have into my blade.</em></p>
<p><em>I shall not pray for a miracle. Such a thing will not lend its aid to my steel.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, I think. In a period of time that is less than a millisecond, a tiny, insignifcant moment shorter than a single grain of an hourglass… I use all my remaining mental capacity to think.</em></p>
<p><em>Fragments of past memories and enemies I had fought, piece by piece, emerge to the surface of my mind. Suzukawa Ryoubu and Shinkai. Nagasaka Ukyou. Fuuma Koutarou and Gassan. </em></p>
<p><em>Ichigao Mizuhi – the bandit leader.</em></p>
<p><em>Sorimachi Ichizou – a yakuza from Kamakura.</em></p>
<p><em>My own sister – Minato Hikaru.</em></p>
<p><em>Every single time I fought them.</em></p>
<p><em>Every single time our blades crossed.</em></p>
<p><em>Every single attack they launched.</em></p>
<p><em>A record of every single battle I fought as Muramasa.</em></p>
<p><em>From the depths of such violent memories reeking of blood, emerge hundreds and thousands of manouvers. Countless ways to kill another. Countless methods of robbing another of their precious lives.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet, there is but one answer I need. The one and only strike I need to overcome this enemy, to topple this battlefield, to emerge victorious from this dance. All the rest are useless.</em></p>
<p><em>I need to choose only one. The one and only way my steel shall respond to hers.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the only path left for me.</em></p>
<p>He then decides to use his ultimate skill.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou… is this really how it should be?</p>
<p>Kageaki: This isn’t about right or wrong! If this is the only path left for me, I can do nothing but follow that very path with all my might!</p>
<p><em>At the very end of our battle, this is what I have chosen. A foolish, inane plan.</em></p>
<p><em>No matter what technique I launch, it will be uselses. No matter what strategy I hatch, it will never come to fruition. The justice she believes in will never yield to such tricks.</em></p>
<p><em>Her soul burns brighter than the sun, its flame fiercer than ever. Approaching it with such unhanded means will only guarantee in my own demise, scorched to death by her radiance.</em></p>
<p><em>There is but one way to extinguish the brightness of her sun – to challenge it with a strike equal in brilliance.</em></p>
<p><em>Ichijou’s justice is unyielding, her Tsurugi’s power limitless; the only path avaiable to me is to crush both of them in one single attack!</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Acknowledged. Beginning the end. Executing death. Manifesting the void.<em></em></p>
<p><em>As long as this one blade finds its target, it matters little how much strength the opponent possesses.</em></p>
<p><em>Everthing is nullified, everything returns to nothingness. And so, Muramasa, with a single strike encompassing such pure, untainted energy, will launch its accursed blade of utmost perfection towards the enemy.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Yoshino Onryuu Fencing School – Thunder of the Gods. Railgun… Magatsu!<em></em></p>
<p><em>Masamune holds the blade back! Raiding his own blade as a shield, he forces the thunderious steel to a halt.</em></p>
<p><em>Masamune breaks the boundarious of reality itself, holding back his enemy’s steel with lightning swiftness – how is he capable of such a feat? Is this the true might of justice?</em></p>
<p><em>Even so…</em></p>
<p><em>I shall put an end to justice!</em></p>
<p><em>The blade in my grip holds my very being – all the sins I carry, all the people I fought and killed, all my memories. Everything that I am!</em></p>

<p>The two clash, and Ichijou falls to her apparent death.</p>
<p><em><br>
</em><em></em></p>

<p><em>Is it… finally over?</em></p>
<p><em>Is this the end… of my fight?</em></p>
<p>However, Muramasa and Kageaki follow her, and end up… well, here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero205.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1034" title="hero205" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero205.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Wh-what in the world is this?</p>
<p><em>Is this… Masamune?</em></p>
<p><em>Th-this is…</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Ichijou…</p>
<p>Muramasa: This isn’t human anymore. It’s<em> not even a Musha, not even a Tsurugi! It’s nothing but…</em></p>
<p><em>Is your will truly this strong?</em></p>
<p>Ichijou:<em> This is not… the end… Far from it…!</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: <em>Justice… shall prevail!</em> Otherwise… all the evil in this world… will remain unpunished…!!</p>
<p><em>I see.</em></p>
<p><em>I finally understood, Ichijou. Our battle wasn’t merely a competition of sheer power anymore. It was a rivalry between our very souls, till the last shreds of life remain in us. Such is the fate of our battle.</em></p>
<p><em>I see, Ichjou. I have finally understood.</em></p>
<p><em>And so, till I draw breath, I shall continue to meet your steel with mine.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Muramasaaaaaaaa…!!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Masamune…</p>
<p><em>As long as your will remains, my soul, too, shall burn bright in response.</em></p>
<p><em>A mess of arteries and internal organs burst open before my eyes – and yet there still remained a thread that connected her consciousness to this world.</em></p>
<p><em>I shall respond to the fiery dance of your soul with my own flame.</em></p>
<p><em>We have posed the questions – of justice, of evil. Their meaning, their significance. So let us continue our dance – till the stars of Minato Kageaki and Ayane Ichijou are extinguished for good.</em></p>
<p><em>The questions we tackle, the ideas we believe in, have surely, in the past, aroused the minds of kings and priests and widows, of knights and scholars, of poets and merchants, farmers and beggars alike.</em></p>
<p><em>So let us continue our search for the answer, dashing straight ahead… on the paths we have chosen for ourselves.<br>
</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">[Epilogue]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero207.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036" title="hero207" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero207.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>We cut to a few years later. A crimson red Musha murders a certain leader that everyone wanted dead – in return, the innocent old man (who wanted to take revenge on said leader for killing his family and selling his grandson to slavery) emerges from the crowd standing around the crimson warrior and kneels before it. “Thank you”, he says. “I offer my life to you in exchange”. The blood-red giant nods, and decapitates the old man.</p>
<p>Then the crimson armor dissolves and its user, an older Ichijou, is slowly revealed.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero208.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913" title="hero208" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero208.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>This is the path she has chosen.</em></p>
<p><em>As for what happened all those years ago…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero209.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037" title="hero209" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero209.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>Only two of them survived that battle:<em> the crimson spider and young girl.</em> The other two – the man and the indigo blue Tsurugi-vanished for good.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>It was a battle lacking a conclusion – one without a true victor.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, the two that had survived were unable to move on.</em></p>
<p><em>The girl had lost the power to fight with. The crimson Tsurugi had lost her master. Nevertheless, they both had their respective duties to carry out. Inevitably, the two of them, once bitter rivals, eventually joined forces.</em></p>
<p><em>However, the steel of the crimson Musha is one bound by a curse. One that the young woman was unable to accept. And yet, with no other options available, she grudingly had to embrace the cursed mantra, and eventually, she came to accept her new partner.</em></p>
<p><em>She tries to keep her sacrifices to the minimum. And when the time comes to slay an enemy -another Musha-, she always arranges for a willing sacrifice in advance, asking for their permission and consent. When no such consent is acquired, she chooses not to fight. It is no doubt a last resort. Many a villain escaped in front of her eyes, simply because she had not wished to sacrifice anyone, and she herself had suffered countless hardships simply by keeping her own power in check.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>During times like that, when all hope is lost, she ends up opening up old wounds once forgotten. As she strikes down the old man who desired the wrath of justice in exchange for his own life,&nbsp;the vivid recollection of a past incident, not entirely unlike her present condition, emerges in her mind. She would remember the death of her father and of a certain other man. Each time she would plunge into battle and take a life, the colors of bygone days would come dancing back into her mind, forcing her to face them head on.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>That was her life now.</em></p>
<p><em>Her current actions no longer reflect what she wished for back then. Her justice – one that would light a fire in the hearts of men, had been forever extinguished. It is once again different from what he wished. She would vow to deliver justice, but at the same time, would turn her back on the people.&nbsp;It is neither what she used to long for, nor what he had hoped to accomplish. She was but a shadow of her former self, a cheapened mass of compromises.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>That is the life she was fated to live. There was always one more option, however. To stop – to give up. It had crossed her mind back then, and it still occupied her thoughts even now. After all, she was shunned and feared by countless men and women.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Are you planning to give up?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero210.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914" title="hero210" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero210.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>To the crimson spider, she was but a cheap replacement. The young woman felt the same about the Tsurugi.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: Never.</p>
<p><em>The world is overflowing with evil. Even now, there exist people who would offer their own lives to a cursed monster such as she, only to see justice be carried out.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I can’t ever give up, can I…?</p>
<p>Muramasa: Indeed.</p>
<p><em>The woman and the Tsurugi share the same opinion, the same will the press on — the same vows they refuse to abandon.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I’ve yet to find the answer I’m looking for. To discover what births strife, and what can bring about peace. Is it justice? Or evil?</p>
<p>Muramasa: That is correct. We have yet to find the answer…</p>
<p><em>Till I find that answer, I cannot ever stop. For that is our duty as the ones who were left behind – we who survived that fateful battle.</em></p>
<p><em>From time to time, she allows herself to be lost in a dream. A dream in which she does not kill her own father. A dream in which he does not kill her own mother.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero211.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039" title="hero211" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero211.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>She would be overcome by deep regret. He, too, would no doubt feel the same way. What the two of them did was something that had to be done – an inescapable outcome. Otherwise, they would have been robbed of things even greater.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>They would have blended into the mass of society and lead their lives like any other people… possibly without ever meeting each other. Was that not the right way to live, after all? Could she have made a terrible mistake? Aiming to walk a straight, correct path… and yet, losing her way along the road? Such doubts would grow stronger in her mind with each passing day.</em></p>
<p><em>In times when she was on the verge of losing heart, she could feel his gaze upon her back. If she turned around, he would be there.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194128/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/hero212.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040" title="hero212" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Hero (Ichijou’s Route finale) _ gareblogs_files/hero212.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>“I am your exact opposite.” -he would say.</em></p>
<p><em>“And I will continue to oppose you till the very end.” – he would frankly declare.</em></p>
<p><em>Had they not walked the same, straight path in opposite directions, she would not be able to see his visage upon turning back. And so, this thought restores her strength and will to press on.</em></p>
<p><em>She was completely on her own, without a single friend by her side. However, there was a certain person, acting as her polar opposite. A man who fully understood her very soul, and told her with unyielding spirit to continue walking on her straight path, without ever faltering. His memory alone supports her now, giving her the strength to move on, wandering this ruined land till the end of her days.</em></p>
<p>Ichijou: I will not lose to you.</p>
<p><em>With renewed resolve, she set out once again. To find the answer she’s been looking for – the answer that he, too, had longed for.</em></p>
<p><em>In the end, whose path could have been the right one? His or hers? Neither, or both…?</em></p>
<p><em>And thus, their rivalry continues still, with no end in sight.</em></p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Beautifull, this sole word defines what I fell after reading this. I’m struck speechless as how such great vn can exist, whoever wrote must be a genius.</p>
<p>Now to say thanks to garejei for the translation, really a great job and I like this route more than Kanae’s one. Finally we can see the Muramasa – Tyrant route, hoping that it will be even better than this one.</p>
<p>Say garejei, which route you liked more?</p>
<p>P.S: An older Ichijou after the time skip was really beautifull.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you, I really appreciate it. Glad you enjoyed the summary.</p>
<p>Personally, I vastly preferred Ichijou’s route so far. I’ll post a new update where I elaborate on this further, so keep checking back. By the way, for the time being I’ve renamed the Tyrant route to Devil King – I still haven’t made up my mind about which one I should use. Maybe I’ll figure it out once I actually begin reading the route and can put the whole thing into context.</p>
