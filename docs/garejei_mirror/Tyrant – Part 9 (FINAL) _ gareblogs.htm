<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This project is a fairly old work of mine, written and translated back in 2012, when I was still just starting out as a fan translator — as such, it’s not exactly the highest quality work I’ve ever put out, to say the least.

<p>So the Epilogue begins with Russia closing in on Yamato, more specifically a place/territory called Mutsu. Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>The governor in charge of Mutsu, after seeing that no reinforcements will come, decides that at this point, even making a pact with a devil is better than giving up his homeland to Russian invaders…</p>
<p>…so he goes to meet and hopefully hire a mercenary group called the Warlords. He knows that the Warlords will gladly go into battle against any enemy as long as the price for their services are paid in full. However, it is implied that the price is the life of the one who hired them.</p>
<p><em>The Mercenary Empire. An order of warriors for hire commonly known as the “Warlords”, residing in a stronghold located 50 kilometres to the west from Oshima Peninsula on the island of Matsumae Ooshima. While the area is rich in seafood, the reason behind their existence on the island lies elsewhere. For their livelihood stems from war itself.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou478/" rel="attachment wp-att-2297"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2297" alt="maou478" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou478.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>They have shown no interest to expand their influence to other areas. They are employed by both those who desire to fuel the fires of war, as well as those who wish to end such conflict.</em></p>
<p><em>It is not their duty to distinguish between good and evil, or to carry out judgement. They care not for their employer’s country, people, or religion. Whether or not they obey the one who hired them is decided by one single thing – the terms of the contract.</em></p>
<p><em>They were known all across the land, both in Yamato and the continent. Despite the cruel nature of their contract, their fame and numbers grew rapidly.</em></p>
<p><em>So did the number of people who detested them.</em></p>
<p>Green Haired Woman: Welcome, Lord Governor. Please, don’t let the environment unsettle you.</p>

<p>Gov: I… I see. Thank you.</p>
<p>GHW: The first thing to do would be to invite you for a cup of tea at the terrace, but you do not appear to be a man who has the luxury of time.</p>
<p>Gov: That’s true…</p>
<p>GHW: Most who turn to us are like that. They sip their refreshments while the land around them burns.</p>
<p>Gov: ……..</p>
<p>GHW: I do believe I haven’t introduced myself yet. My name is Ouliga, the public representative of the Warlords. If you don’t mind, let us get right to the point.</p>
<p>Gov: I see. Are you authorized to make decisions?</p>
<p>Ouliga: Oh, no, I merely carry out the duties of a negotiator. The one who makes the final decision is…</p>
<p>She gestures towards a certain person offscreen.</p>
<p>?????: ……….</p>
<p>Gov: That man?</p>
<p>Ouliga: Yes. The Warlord. Even though that term is the name of our order, if there is any one person who could symbolize our entire organization, it is him. The reason is simple -for &nbsp;even when he was a lesser man, he had already been carrying out the mission of the Warlords.</p>
<p>Gov: So basically… he’s your boss?</p>
<p>Ouliga: “Boss”? I like the sound of that. Yes, you could think of him that way.</p>
<p>Warlord: ………..</p>
<p>Ouliga: Oh my. You see, he’s not much of a talker. In any case, let us get to the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Gov: Yes. To put it bluntly, I’d like to hire you.</p>
<p>Ouliga: All in order to drive back the Russian troops, am I correct?</p>
<p>Gov: You knew?</p>
<p>Ou: The constant flow of reliable information is essential for our order. Even if a political uproar should happen on the other side of the globe, we would know of it within an hour. Acquiring information on local happenings is naturally even easier for us.</p>
<p>Gov: That saves me the trouble of having to explain things. Indeed, we are being attacked by Russian forces…</p>
<p>Ou: …that are planning to carry out a naval assault tomrrow.</p>
<p>Gov: Tomorrow?!</p>
<p>Ou: Hm? You didn’t know? Oh dear. It wasn’t my intention to give out information for free… but I suppose it doesn’t matter anymore. This one’s on the house, then. Consider it a gift.</p>
<p>Gov: Are you certain it’s tomorrow?</p>
<p>Ou: Well, depending on the sea and shifts in the wind, their operation might have to be postponed… Oh, and if you plan on praying to the divines to influence the wind, I can show you to a good shrine~</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou480/" rel="attachment wp-att-2295"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2295" alt="maou480" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou480.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Gov: There won’t be a need for that. In the previous war, I’ve learned the harsh way how futile it is to depend on prayer.</p>
<p>So basically he says that he doesn’t have enough money to hire them for a longer period of time – therefore, he wants to hire them to launch an attack right away instead of defending for a longer period of time. Ouliga agrees.</p>
<p>Ouliga: No complaints on our part. Well then. What happens now depends on you. Surely you are aware of the nature of our contract…?</p>
<p>Gov: I’ve heard the rumors.</p>
<p>Ouliga: I do belive I should explain to you in detail the reasons behind such a contract.</p>
<p>Gov: No need to do that.</p>
<p>Ou: You do not wish to know?</p>
<p>Gov: I have a feeling I would be better off not knowing. I’d like to die knowing that I fulfilled my responsibilities to my homeland.</p>
<p>Ou: I see. In that case, I will not bore you with details. So… can we take what you have just said as a sign of your consent?</p>
<p>Gov: Yes. I have no plans to leave this place alive.</p>
<p>Ou: Well then, one last thing.</p>
<p>Gov: Yes?</p>
<p>Ou: Let me ask you this – do you desire power?</p>
<p>Gov: Yes. I do.</p>
<p>Ou: Very well. Warlord!</p>
<p>Warlord: ……….</p>
<p>Ou: Let us begin mobilizing our forces. We shall destroy the Russian headquarters along with their ships. It will all be done by the time the day is out. You can rest assured.</p>
<p>Gov: I am grateful to you – you took a heavy load off my shoulders.</p>
<p>Ou: No need to thank us. This is all part of the contract, after all. However…</p>
<p>Gov: ……?</p>
<p>Ou: It would be best if you did not misunderstand the situation.</p>
<p>Gov: What do you mean…?</p>
<p>Ou: ………</p>
<p>Ou: Kurabe Tatewaki!</p>
<p>Warrior: Present!</p>
<p>Ou: I am leaving this mission in you and your men’s care. Now… utter the words of the Warlords: the law that we abide by!</p>
<p>Warrior: Death upon the wicked and the just! *</p>
<p>Ou: And how will you carry out your mission?</p>
<p>Warrior: I will take note of the enemy soldiers we slay… and therefore kill an equal number of citizens in Mutsu.</p>
<p>Ou: Very good.</p>
<p>(The moment he utters these words, the ominous main theme of Muramasa starts playing.)</p>
<p>Ou: However, make sure to leave one of them alive. Now go!</p>
<p>(who will no doubt serve to balance out the Governor’s death.)</p>
<p>Warrior: Yes, ma’am!</p>
<p>Gov: Wh-what did you just say?! Are you planning to massacre the citizens of Mutsu as well?!</p>
<p>Ou: You see, we aren’t merely assassinating the enemy general. In order to make the numbers add up, an equal number of lives must be taken. We will take that number from the very people you are trying to protect.</p>
<p>Gov: Are you planning to murder an equal number of enemies and allies?!</p>
<p>Ou: Exactly.</p>
<p>Gov: ………</p>
<p>Ou: Hmm… it seems like you did not fully understand the nature of our contract. Regretting it now will do you no good, however. Especially since you did not do anything wrong. Had you not come to us, the Russian army, under the banner of their own “justice”, would have massacred each and every one of your citizens without leaving any survivors. However, we, the Warlords, will never let that happen. We will make sure to bring death upon both parties equally. We will not let justice prevail.</p>
<p>Gov: Why?! Why are you doing this?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou481/" rel="attachment wp-att-2294"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2294" alt="maou481" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou481.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Ou: But you’ve just told me a few minutes ago that you did not wish to hear our reasons…</p>
<p>Gov: Explain yourself!</p>
<p>Our: Why must we kill both enemies and allies? Why must both good and evil fall? Because… that is the nature of the power you desired.</p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>*He basically says “zenaku sousatsu” (善悪相殺), which I most often translated as “the counterbalance of good and evil” and sometimes as “death upon the wicked and the just” or “death upon both good and evil”. The reason for that is because I kinda feel like the term in Japanese has this dual meaning – one is the more literal “kill good and evil”, while the other is the deeper meaning based on Nicolas Flamel’s long speech back in Tyrant Part 1, about the relativity of such concepts as good and evil. The term “zenaku sousatsu” encompasses all that, which is why giving it one fixed translation could be tricky.</p>
<p>And thus ends the Epilogue of “Tyrant”.</p>
<p>We now launch into a new (and final) route, titled “Daemon” – 悪鬼. However, I won’t treat it as a separate route because I don’t want to confuse people – plus, it’s a direct continuation of Tyrant.</p>

<p>Muramasa: Midou…</p>
<p>Kageaki: …………</p>
<p>Muramasa: You’re going to catch a cold, so… please, let’s go home for today.</p>
<p><em>The scientific wonder, that peculiar monster of a sun that left astronomers speechless, has vanished for good. However, the wicked seeds its song had planted within the hearts of men did not disappear along with it. The cries of the battlefield roared loudly all across the world still. Men killed men – corpses piled upon corpses without end.</em></p>
<p><em>The heavens burned. The earth decayed. The very air was heavy with violence.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p><em>I survived that day…</em></p>
<p><em>…even though I was certain that I had put an end to my own life. I should have slipped away into the darkness, never to return – and yet, here I am, gazing at this world where everything had come to an end.</em></p>
<p><em>Muramasa suggested that it might have been Hikaru who had brought me back from the verge of death, using her last ounce of remaining power. Of course, there is no proof to support this, and I had no other ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>I did not fully regret that things ended up this way – after all, I had a promise with the prince and my foster father. After everything was over, I was to be executed. to recieve the appropriate judgement of the law for all my accumulated sins. To appease the anger of all those whose lives I had taken. However, they ignored their promise and insisted that I take the time to rest.</em></p>
<p><em>Why do I still draw breath? There remains nothing in this battered body of mine other than deep regret.</em></p>
<p><em>I killed Hikaru. The only person that I wanted to save more than anyone else died by my hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Could there have been any other way?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou485/" rel="attachment wp-att-2290"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" alt="maou485" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou485.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>Upon realizing that it was the only option from the beginning, I am once again overcome by feelings of regret. If I had acted sooner, the lives lost and the damage done would not have escalated to its current state. The fires of insanity that boil the world have yet to die out.</em></p>
<p><em>If only I had been able to kill Hikaru two years ago… it wouldn’t have come to this.</em></p>
<p><em>I am thinking of some way to make use of my life. At the very least, I should do something to quell the fires of this maddened world – it is my responsibility to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>However…</em></p>
<p><em>What could a man such as I accomplish? How am I supposed to put an end to the storm of conflict that swept over the entire world?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou486/" rel="attachment wp-att-2289"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2289" alt="maou486" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou486.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>Could I determine who was right and who was wrong and thus vanquish the one labeled as evil? Of course not. Conflict itself is governed by the counterbalance of good and evil. The victory of such self-righteous hypocrisy would only serve to sow the seeds of yet more conflict. It isn’t something I could possibly partake in.</em></p>
<p><em>What else could I do? Wave the banner of peace? No doubt, that would be the correct course of action. However, only one who is fit for such duty can advocate peace. A man such as I, the murderer of countless men and women, has no right to do any such thing. Who would possibly lend an ear to me? It is a futile effort.</em></p>
<p><em>I took many lives and brought misfortune upon the world. I am refused judgement, and lack the power to end conflict or advocate peace.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet… I keep on living. For there is nothing else I can do.</em></p>
<p><em>Why? Why do I go on living? For what purpose?!</em><br>
—</p>
<p>We switch to Muramasa’s point of view.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou487/" rel="attachment wp-att-2288"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2288" alt="maou487" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou487.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>Kageaki is out again, no doubt wandering the streets, contemplating the insignificance of his own life.</em></p>
<p><em>No one is blaming him, though. However, even if I shouted that from the top of my lungs, it wouldn’t change anything. When he’s not here, I’m alone in the house.</em></p>
<p><em>Ever since we defeated the Ginseigou, my heart has been heavy. It could be due to the fact that my mission has been completed, my very reason to exist nullified. The past five hundred years, and the two that followed, the partings, the battles, the deaths – it all seems so distant now. As I near the end of my mission as a Tsurugi, all other sensations are slowly becoming duller.</em></p>
<p>She then thinks about Kageaki.</p>
<p><em>Even when he loses his very reason to exist, his flesh and blood forces him to continue living like nothing had happened, engulfed by nothing but shame and regret. He did not wish for such an outcome. Naturally, I’m glad that he did not die – but I did not wish for him to be spared only to continue living in agony.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to do something…</em></p>
<p><em>*My* role is already over. I can rot away in eternal slumber for all I care. However, I cannot allow him to remain this way.</em></p>
<p>We cut to the evening, with Kageaki drowning his sorrows in alcohol, and is wondering why he was spared.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou488/" rel="attachment wp-att-2287"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2287" alt="maou488" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou488.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>After a while Muramasa stops him.</p>
<p>Mur: You’ve already had so much… please, you should rest.</p>
<p>Kageaki then grabs her arm as a response, and pushes her down to the floor, implying that if he can’t have his alcohol, he’ll use some other means to relieve himself.</p>
<p><em>What am I doing? – I ask myself, realizing this isn’t something to be done at a time like this. I am about to rape Muramasa. I have no doubts that she herself realized this as well. </em></p>
<p><em>I continue. I press my tongue against the nape of her neck.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa is on the verge of tears, but does not resist.</p>
<p><em>I am disgusting.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou489/" rel="attachment wp-att-2286"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2286" alt="maou489" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou489.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>And what of it? It would imply that I had not been disgusting up until now. That is not the case. And a vile man should at least act the part. I allow myself to sink deeper and deeper into depravity. She will forgive me.</em></p>
<p>He’s about to take her clothes off. He suddenly realizes what he’s about to do and stops, screams in anger and runs out of the house, into the night.</p>
<p><em>I am a monster. The lowest of the low. I disgust myself.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to turn into a dog, or an ant, or a frog – anything! Anything in this world would be nobler than a man such as I!</em></p>
<p>He basically goes on and on about how he should be punished (there, 20 lines of narration summed up in a sentence). Pretty much the same deal as in Kanae’s route. He even takes the blame on himself for all the violence that goes on in the world, and thinks that in that way, he’s still killing thousands every second.</p>
<p>He gets roped into a shady meeting by a fortune teller, who tells him that his life is at a crossroads. There, he meets a guy who claims that the reason the country is going to shit is because 500 years ago, the emperor was chosen from the Southern Dynasty, even though the legitimate ruler was supposed to be from the North. He claims that he himself is a descendant of the legitimate emperor, and therefore he is equal to God, and everyone should bow to him or else they won’t be saved (yeah, seems legit). Kageaki loses his shit and grabs the guy, shouting at him that if he’s really God, he should have saved the world instead of letting himself be killed by a man like Kageaki. He screams and in his rage, throws the fraud to the ground.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou490/" rel="attachment wp-att-2285"><img alt="maou490" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou490.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p><em>God… is dead.</em></p>
<p><em>There exists no entity that would conveniently free us from our sins when we want it. We are doomed.</em></p>
<p>Completely drunk off his ass, Kageaki then stumbles into a bunch of people arguing about a destroyed bridge and how they can’t cross.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou491/" rel="attachment wp-att-2284"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2284" alt="maou491" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou491.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I see, I see. That will simply not do. How about using a knife or a fork instead…?</p>
<p>(Silly Japanese pun here. “Bridge” and “chopsticks” are pronounced the same way (hashi).</p>
<p>He keeps on begging them to punish him, and then collapses. He looks up at the sky and begins laughing to himself, thinking about how silly it was of Hikaru to smash the moon.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou492/" rel="attachment wp-att-2283"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2283" alt="maou492" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou492.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>Hikaru…</em></p>
<p><em>Why did you not destroy me along with the moon?</em></p>
<p><em>Why couldn’t you take me with you…?</em></p>
<p><em>Why…</em></p>
<p>He passes out, and wakes up the next day in someoe else’s house.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou493/" rel="attachment wp-att-2282"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2282" alt="maou493" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou493.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Some kid shows up and brings him food and water. Kageaki looks around and notices that she’s alone, and that most of the furniture is covered in dust. He asks the kid about her parents, and she tells him that they’re both gone. Her father was a soldier but never came home, and upon hearing the sad news, her mother just ran off somewhere. She now lives alone and survives by helping out the local greengrocers, who gives her food in return.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the food she gave Kageaki was her own lunch. Kageaki apologizes, but she says that it’s fine, because to her, it seemed like Kageaki needed the food more than she did, so she gave it to him.</p>
<p>Kageaki: My apologies, I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Minato Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kid: Kageaki…?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes. Would you be so kind as to tell me your name as well?</p>
<p>Kid: Yep. It’s Hikari.</p>
<p>Kageaki is speechless.</p>
<p>Hikari: Hikari. H-I-K-A-R-I.</p>
<p>(The kanji is the same as Hikaru’s name – 光)</p>
<p>Kageki: A-ah… i-it’s a splendid name! If I had a child of my own, I would name her the same.</p>
<p><em>I could barely breathe. I was taken by complete surprise by her, making my heart race so fast that I had to put serious effort into regaining my composure.</em></p>
<p>He then also learns from Hikari that the previous night, he managed to stop the quarrel about the bridge and the matter ended without a fight, thanks to him.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Hikari: You seem happy, mister.</p>
<p>Kag: O-oh… is that so?</p>
<p>She then tells him that after he collapsed, a certain other woman helped her drag him back here. Obviously, that certain someone was Muramasa, who’s also in the house.</p>
<p>We cut to outside after Kageaki and Muramasa had left the house. Kageaki concludes that they’ve strayed quite far from Kamakura’s downtown area.</p>

<p>Muramasa: ………..</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………..</p>
<p>Mur: U-um…</p>
<p>Kag: Yes?</p>
<p>Mur: Are you feeling better?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes. I think…</p>
<p>Mur: I see.</p>
<p>Kag: Um, Muramasa…</p>
<p>Mur: Yes?</p>
<p>Kag: It’s about last night…</p>
<p>Mur: *gasps and blushes*</p>
<p>Kag: I’m really sorry.</p>
<p>Mur: …….</p>

<p>Kag: I do know this isn’t something that can be solved just by apologizing, but…</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, um… it’s fine! D-don’t worry about it.</p>
<p>Kag: That won’t do.</p>
<p>Mur: You know, I… I, um… if it’s what you wanted, I would gladly, um….</p>
<p>Kag: In any case, I promise you not to do something foolish like that ever again.</p>
<p>Mur: *pissed off face* Oh, r-really…?</p>
<p>Kag: I swear it upon the heavens.</p>

<p>Mur: Mhmm-hmm~ Ahahahahaha~</p>
<p>Kag: Mu-Muramasa…?</p>
<p>Mur: Yeeees…?</p>
<p>Kag: You’re mad at me, aren’t you?</p>
<p>Mur: Now why would you think that?</p>
<p>Kag: No, I mean, it’s just…</p>
<p>Mur: Why would I be angry, hmm~? See how I’m just beaming with a smile?</p>
<p>Kag: Th-that’s true… I must’ve been imagining things.</p>
<p>Mur: Indeed~ You say such weird things sometimes, ahahaha~</p>
<p>Kag: I see…</p>
<p>Mur: *crazy person laughter*</p>
<p>(See, this is one of those scenes that are a million times better if you hear the voice acting for it.)</p>
<p>Mur: *sigh* Anyway, let’s head home, Midou. It’s not like we have anything to do here.</p>
<p>Kag: No, wait a second. There’s still something I’d like to do.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou498/" rel="attachment wp-att-2277"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2277" alt="maou498" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou498.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>So he heads off to get ingredients and make food for Hikari. To sum up the scenes that follow, Kageaki goes back to the bridge people were arguing about last night. As it turns out, a large number of refugees have been pouring into Kamakura with nowhere else to go, and the regular citizens are irritated. To make things worse, someone destroyed a very important bridge, forcing townsfolk to take a big detour if they wanted to cross the river.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou499/" rel="attachment wp-att-2276"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2276" alt="maou499" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou499.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Refugee camp pictured above.</p>
<p>The citizens believe it was the refugees who destroyed the bridge – however, the refugees claim they did no such thing. Kageaki talks to the refugees and proposes that they begin rebuilding the bridge with his help, so that the citizens will see that they mean no harm, and thus will eventually accept them. The construction begins, although it takes time, and some the citizens are mocking the refugees. Still, Kageaki encourages them to continue. It seems like he’s finally found a reason to live.</p>
<p>A few days pass, and we cut back to Hikari’s house.</p>
<p>Hik: Kageaki… why do you try so hard to help others?</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm… Because “to preserve harmony among people is most precious of all treasures.”</p>
<p>Hik: Har… mony…?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes. It’s the old saying of a very clever man. It means that people should get along and help each other instead of quarreling. If they do that, they can accomplish anything. Growing food, erecting buildings… anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou502/" rel="attachment wp-att-2273"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2273" alt="maou502" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou502.jpg" width="584" height="333"></a></p>
<p>Hik: Oh…! They can build houses and stuff?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes.</p>
<p>Hik: Zoos as well?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes.</p>
<p>Hik: And movie theaters?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes, those too.</p>
<p>Hik: Hmm… but how do you do that…?</p>
<p>Kag: The same way you offered your own food to me the other day, even though you yourself were in need of it as well. You see, there are countless people who help others when it’s convenient for them, but only a few would help a person in need when they themselves are suffering. When people are going through hard times, their top priority is to ensure their own safety. But you were different. What you did was very mature.</p>
<p>Hik: I see…</p>
<p><em>Seemingly not accustomed to being praised, Hikari hanged her head and gazed at the floor.</em></p>
<p>Kag: As long as people put the needs of others before their own, the fires of conflict will not emerge. It is a truly noble thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou501/" rel="attachment wp-att-2274"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2274" alt="maou501" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou501.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>The next day, he discovers that the bridge they have been building has collapsed due the rise of the water levels caused by the rainy weather. They are discouraged at first, but an old man (a former carpenter) tells them that this is the result of their amateur work and no experience with building bridges. He agrees to help them build the bridge, and Kageaki is genuinely surprised by the fact that he’s able to mobilize both refugees and regular citizens together – the two sides are finally cooperating for a common goal.</p>
<p>One evening, he finally discovers that the secret third party destroying the bridge with saws and other tools was the local yakuza gang, led by the same dude from Chapter 1. Kageaki asks them to leave, but they refuse and draw their swords. Kageaki asks Muramasa to send forth his blade, Kotetsu, and promptly knocks out all the yakuza with the blunt side of the blade.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou503/" rel="attachment wp-att-2272"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2272" alt="maou503" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou503.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>He realizes that the townsfolk are staring at him, and realizes that it must be because he’s holding a sword. He quickly asks Muramasa to take the sword back, making it disappear.</p>
<p>However, the sight of a sword that can materialize and disappear at will frightens the townsfolk even more.</p>
<p>Man: His sword disappeared…?! D-don’t tell me that rumor about him was true… actually… w-we heard that you had killed countless men up until now… i-is that true…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..h-huh…?</p>
<p>Man: We heard you care not who your victims are, even if they are women or children…</p>
<p>Kag: ………………..</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou504/" rel="attachment wp-att-2271"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2271" alt="maou504" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou504.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>Who told them?</em></p>
<p><em>Who told them that terrible truth?</em></p>
<p>Man2: H-hey, what are you blurting out all of a sudden?!</p>
<p>Man: Well, I didn’t believe it either, but… didn’t you just see how he made his sword appear and disappear after he mopped the floor with that yakuza rabble? Only Musha are capable of such things!</p>
<p>Man2: Hold your horses! Even if that policeman over there is a Musha, surely he’s not a murderer! *turns to Kageaki* Right?</p>
<p>Kag: ………..</p>
<p>Man2: W-why… aren’t you saying anything…?</p>
<p>Kag: …………</p>
<p><em>What could I possibly tell them? That I’m not a murderer? An utter lie like that?</em></p>
<p>Man2: D-don’t tell me you really did…</p>
<p>More people flood onto the street and approach Kageaki. Eventually the citizens and refugees start arguing and fighting because each side thinks that they hired Kageaki to kill them. Kageaki watches on in terror as the people he’s finally managed to reconcile are now fighting because of his mistake.</p>
<p>Kageaki: St-stop it… Stop…!! Ah… Ahhhhhhhh…!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou505/" rel="attachment wp-att-2270"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2270" alt="maou505" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou505.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>The quarreling people then freeze in place and all look it him with expressions of pure fear. Kageaki cripples under the pressure and screams in horror. He then runs away, and we see that Hikari was actually nearby, witnessing the entire scene.</p>
<p>Kageaki goes home and starts drinking heavily once again, concluding that everything he did was futile, that the hope of peace was but an illusion.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou… you tried your best and did well. There is nothing for you to be ashamed of.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou506/" rel="attachment wp-att-2269"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2269" alt="maou506" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou506.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kag: No, I should be ashamed – more than anyone. Ashamed of the fact that I have not been punished for any of my sins.</p>
<p>Kag: Why am I still alive…?</p>
<p>Mur: *pissed*</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou507/" rel="attachment wp-att-2268"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2268" alt="maou507" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou507.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Kag: I do not deserve to live…</p>
<p>Muramasa then decides that she’s had enough of his shit, and knocks him on the floor.</p>
<p>Mur: Why do you have to always be like that?! Just moping around, brooding and licking your wounds all day?!</p>
<p>Kag: W-why…? Well, uh… but more importantly, shouldn’t you do something about this position?</p>
<p>Mur: *screams*</p>
<p>Kag: Calm down, Muramasa! Please… calm down.</p>
<p>Mur: No! You should be happy that you’re alive, even if you’re helpless! Why do you have to go to such lengths in loathing yourself?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou508/" rel="attachment wp-att-2267"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2267" alt="maou508" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou508.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kag: I just-</p>
<p>Mur: The bugs and worms and insects of the earth basically do nothing but eat away at the soil all day, and even those creatures are allowed to live! The same goes for you!</p>
<p>Kag: No, I mean-</p>
<p>Mur: I’m trying to tell you something important right now so just shut up and listen! If you really think that there’s no point to your life, consider the opposite – that there is meaning in merely being alive like this! The heavens do nothing without a purpose, so just be content that you’re alive!</p>
<p>Kag: But…</p>
<p>Mur: But what?</p>
<p>Kag: I committed terrible sins. That is an undeniable fact. Therefore, I have to face the consequences of those actions.</p>
<p>Mur: *pissed* Oh, sure, sure! Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone could properly take responsibility for all the things they’ve done! However, whether or not you can actually do that is another matter. Just who do you think you are?! Some sort of superhuman who’s above all other average mortals?!</p>
<p>Kag: About that-</p>
<p>Mur: The world is filled with people crippled by their responsibilities! There are countless others who just want to forget everything and avoid facing their problems! By your reasoning, are they all worthless human beings as well?!</p>
<p>Kag: No, I-</p>
<p>Mur: Of course not! That is simply what it means to be human!</p>
<p><em>Indeed, the world is filled with people who turn away from their responsibilities. However, the problems of those people fade in comparison to my heavy sins. How could I possibly forget all that and live a wretched, miserable life…?</em></p>
<p>Mur: *basically frothing at the mouth with rage, if you have the game you should just listen to the audio*</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, I know! I should teach a lesson.</p>
<p>Kag: Wait! Just wait a second!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou508b/" rel="attachment wp-att-2301"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2301" alt="maou508b" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou508b.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Mur: O-okay… Mother told me there is no man who wouldn’t get aroused by this.</p>
<p>She then basically proceeds to give him a footjob.</p>
<p>Mur: W-what just happened? I-it moved!</p>
<p>Kag: You don’t need to touch it if you’re scared.</p>
<p>Mur: I’m not! Mmm-hmm~ You sure are depraved! Just look at yourself! By doing this, I’ll make you realize that you aren’t nobler than any other man– wh-wh-what was that? Why is that thing moving around like that?</p>
<p>Kag: You clearly are the less composed here…</p>
<p>Muramasa then proceeds to try (and fail) to do the superior dominatrix act.</p>
<p>Mur: Living beings can do nothing but live! I don’t want to hear you say that there is no purpose to it! If you truly think you’re so worthless… then continue to live with that thought! Feel free to think that you’re garbage! Admit to yourself that you’re utterly powerless in the face of your responsibilities! And I’ll… I’ll be here to look down on you for it.</p>
<p>She then undresses and is ready to actually have proper sex with him.</p>
<p>Kag: Please, stop…</p>
<p>Mur: What, you don’t like it?!</p>
<p>Kag: No, that’s not it… it’s just that-</p>
<p>Mur: If I remember correctly, you did try to do this to me not too long ago, and stopped midway. Gosh, just thinking about it pisses me off!</p>
<p>Kag: That time was different-</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, just shut up already! You wanted to do *this*, didn’t you?</p>
<p>So they *finally* have sex, and Kageaki basically accepts that he’s not perfect, and that he’s a man who desires such pleasures despite all the sins he had committed. In other words, thanks to Muramasa, his soul seems to be at ease for the moment.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa.</p>
<p>Mur: …..?</p>
<p>Kag: You’re out of your mind.</p>
<p><em>I have never been comforted like this before. Even clumsiness has its limits. However, that part of her fascinated me – she was beautiful in her own way.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p>Mur: ……….</p>
<p>Kag: Please, stay by my side.</p>
<p>Mur: Okay…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou510/" rel="attachment wp-att-2265"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2265" alt="maou510" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou510.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>For the first time since Hikaru died -no, since my foster mother died- I have finally found true peace. A feeling I did not believe I would be granted ever again.</em></p>
<p><em>I cherish the warmth of her body in my embrace. Once before, I had my sights set on nothing but the coldness of her steel – and now, I long for the warmth of her skin. I laugh to myself, realizing how foolish I used to be.</em></p>
<p><em>I finally succumbed to the call of dreams, and for the first time in two years, slept without worries.</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>The next morning, Kageaki wakes up to Muramasa preparing breakfast.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou511/" rel="attachment wp-att-2264"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2264" alt="maou511" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou511.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p><em>I am alive. I can feel it from the bottom of my soul.</em></p>
<p><em>There was nothing special about my life. Nothing was added to its worth that would elevate it to such heights. It was a small, insignificant little thing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was simply… alive.</em></p>
<p><em>I overcame my former arrogance to realize my own limits as a person.</em></p>
<p><em>I am certain that I will one day pay the price for all the sins I had committed. I truly believe that.</em></p>
<p><em>Until that day comes, I will keep on living and &nbsp;believing in that fact.</em></p>
<p>One hour passes. Muramasa’s *still* in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Kag: You’re still not done…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou512/" rel="attachment wp-att-2263"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2263" alt="maou512" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou512.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Mur: Just give me a bit more time!</p>
<p>Kag: Don’t worry about it. I didn’t mean to hurry you.</p>
<p>More time passes, and Kageaki hears some strange voices from the kitchen, including that of a drill and a hammer.</p>
<p>Mur: Just a bit more!</p>
<p>Kag: O-okay…</p>
<p>Some more time passes, she’s still cooking.</p>
<p>Mur: <em>Beginning the end. Executing death. Manifesting the void.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Just what exactly are you cooking in there?!</p>
<p><em>In the end, I decided to help her out, and we finally treated ourselves to an early lunch instead of breakfast.</em></p>
<p>[end of hijinks]</p>
<p>They then go out and take a walk, talking about trivial things like the different seasons. Muramasa says that she used to hate winter, but the two of them conclude that there’s a certain charm to the constant change of seasons. Basically, when it’s summer, we long for winter and vice versa, and this anticipation is what gives it its magic.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou513/" rel="attachment wp-att-2262"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2262" alt="maou513" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou513.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>They then go to the local park and discover a bunch of people selling their things – think of it like a garage sale without the garage. Their goods are all laid out on a number of sheets/blankets and stuff. They eventually run into a rather lively female shopkeeper who runs an antique store of sorts. Kageaki browses some of the antique pots in her selection.</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm… how about this one?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Oh, that’s Shigaraki ware! A true rarity!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou514/" rel="attachment wp-att-2261"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2261" alt="maou514" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou514.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Not bad.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: It’s not glazed, but that’s all part of its charm!</p>
<p>Kag: Indeed…</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Go on, dear customer! Feel free to touch it!</p>
<p><em>She took hold of my hand and guided it towards the pot.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Hm…</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: How are you liking it, sir?</p>
<p>Kag: It’s nice and smooth.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: It makes your spine tingle with excitement, does it not?</p>
<p>Kag: It does indeed.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: *blushing* Ah~ Dear customer, if we continue on like this, even I might start getting weird thoughts…</p>
<p>Kag: Miss…</p>
<p>Mur: JUST WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?!</p>
<p>Kag: The pot.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: The pot, naturally.</p>
<p>Mur: O-oh. I see…</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: So what will it be, my dear customer? It’s a bit expensive, but you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>Kag: How much?</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: As a special discount for a ladykiller like you…</p>
<p>She shows the price to Kageaki.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: This much.</p>
<p>Kag: That’s beyond my budget, I’m afraid…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou515/" rel="attachment wp-att-2260"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2260" alt="maou515" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou515.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Oh, that’s a bummer. But you see, this dates back to the Edo period, or possibly even before that! I cannot possibly part with it for any less.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Aw, but who cares. It might not be a good deal for me, but just for you… how about this?</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm…</p>
<p>Mur: *to the shopkeeper, in a pissed/jealous tone* I believe it’s about time you let go of his hand…</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Aw, my dear customer – you know I have to make a living as well! How about we settle on this price?</p>
<p>Kag: You are dangerously persuasive…</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Oh, don’t be like that! Tell you what – if you buy it, I’ll personally deliver it to your place! And maybe add in a little extra “service’ while I’m there~ &lt;3</p>
<p>So Muramasa gets pissed/jealous, and proves that the pot she was trying to sell him was a fake. Kageaki eventually asks Muramasa to determine which pot is the oldest in the shopkeeper’s selection. Muramasa points it out, and Kageaki picks it up, lifts the lid and blows inside. He then promptly gets dust all over his face and starts coughing. Muramasa gently scolds him and starts wiping it off him.</p>
<p>Mur: Seriously. You act like such a child sometimes.</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm… I do?</p>
<p>So they leave, and after looking at all the other stores, decide to take a rest and sit on a nearby bench.</p>
<p>Kag: I’ve actually dreamed of having an antique shop of my own. But it was a very long time ago – a boyhood daydream at best, which never came true. Spending the entire day in a gloomy shop, busying myself with polishing and taking care of all the antiques in the store… I would’ve loved to live a life like that.</p>

<p>Mur: Hmm~</p>
<p>Mur: So why don’t you do it now?</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm… I see. You’re right. Maybe I should. What about you, though? What did you dream of as a child?</p>
<p>Mur: *sigh* Well, I was born an Emishi, so I had no future prospects other than becoming a blacksmith and eventually forging a Tsurugi of my own.</p>
<p>Kag: I see…</p>
<p>Mur: But, well… it’s not like I didn’t think about it. I’ve always had this dream, ever since I was little… I’ve always heard how the ladies in the service of the Imperial Court wore the prettiest of dresses. It’s something I wanted to try myself… at least that’s what I thought from time to time. Mother got really angry when I told her, though…</p>
<p>Kag: Hmm.</p>
<p>Mur: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Kag: Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that it might prove to be somewhat difficult to make that dream come true…</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, don’t you worry about that. It’s fine. It’s just something I wanted when I was very little, it’s no big deal. Even if I had been given the opportunity to become a court lady, I would have chosen the life of the blacksmith.</p>
<p>Kag: ……..</p>
<p>Mur: *blushing* Had I not become a Tsurugi, I never would have met you. Ours might have been nothing more than a chance encounter, but… two months ago, that afternoon… you told me I was the only one for you.</p>
<p>Kag: ………..</p>
<p>Mur: We’ve been through so much. Our time together certainly had its ups and downs, but in the end… I’m truly glad that I became a Tsurugi.</p>
<p><em>My heart was racing faster and faster; my entire body was overcome by a peculiar sensation. What could this feeling be…? I had to avert my eyes from Muramasa to be able to calm myself.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Hm? What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Kag: It’s nothing.</p>
<p>Mur: You’re acting a bit strange.</p>
<p>Kag: No, I’m not.</p>
<p>Mur: What’s eating you, honestly?</p>
<p>Kag: Nothing in particular…</p>
<p>Mur: Hmm~</p>
<p>So Kageaki gets embarrassed, and evades the question by bringing up Muramasa’s dream again.</p>
<p>Kag: I was just thinking about what you said earlier… about becoming a court lady.</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, enough of that already! I told you it wasn’t a big deal!</p>
<p>Kag: Well, making you into a proper court lady is probably out of our reach at this point, but there might be something else we could do. Something that would be a similar experience.</p>
<p>Mur: What do you mean?</p>

<p>We cut a bit later. They go to a hotel that also has a costume rental shop for parties and such.</p>
<p>Mur: So… this is what you would call a “similar experience”?</p>
<p>Kag: It’s a matter of interpretation.</p>
<p>Mur: More like a misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Kag: It’s… perfect.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou518/" rel="attachment wp-att-2257"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2257" alt="maou518" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou518.jpg" width="584" height="710"></a></p>
<p>Mur: I’d like to know what this outfit is, but at the same time, it’s probably better that I don’t…</p>
<p>Kag: It’s the uniform worn by young ladies who serve under noblemen and such. It looks good on you. No, even more than that – it’s just wonderful.</p>
<p>Mur: I’m grateful for the praise, but… you sound like such a weirdo right now. Like there was something wrong with your head.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou519/" rel="attachment wp-att-2256"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2256" alt="maou519" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou519.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kag: If this is an illness, it’s one that almost every man alive is suffering from. Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p>Mur: That’s great. So – what am I supposed to do now?</p>
<p>Kag: Ah, that’s right. How about serving me some tea?</p>
<p>She goes over to the teapot, but in her clumsiness, spills some of the drink.</p>
<p>Mur: O-oh, I’m so sorry! I’ve never used something like this before, so I didn’t know how to handle it properly! Oh gosh, I’ll need to clean this up now…</p>
<p>Kag: HNNNNNNG</p>
<p>Mur: Wh-why are you getting all aroused?!</p>
<p>Kag: Ah, my apologies. I lost my composure there for a second. Please, continue. And feel free to make *all* the mistakes you want.</p>
<p>Mur: Well, I won’t! I’ll go ahead and refill this, so wait just a second.</p>
<p>He continues staring at her like a perv.</p>
<p>Mur: ………..</p>
<p>Kag: ………..</p>
<p>Mur: Um…</p>
<p>Kag: *in a pervy tone* Yes?</p>
<p>Mur: The way you’re staring is kind of bothering me…</p>
<p>Kag: And why would that be…?</p>
<p>Mur: The air is practically heavy with your aura of lewdness.</p>
<p>Kag: Is it now.</p>
<p>Mur: You aren’t having any weird thoughts, are you…?</p>
<p>Kag: Actually, I am.</p>
<p>Mur: At least *try* to deny it! You’re driving me into a corner here!</p>
<p>Kag: Which was my intention.</p>
<p>Mur: No! Absolutely not! Not here!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou520/" rel="attachment wp-att-2255"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2255" alt="maou520" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou520.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>So he basically takes out his dick and thrusts it in her face. You sure don’t fuck around, Kageaki.</p>
<p>Mur: Pervert.</p>
<p>Kag: How rude. If you would curse anyone, curse that outfit of yours.</p>
<p>Mur: But it was you who made me wear it!</p>
<p>Kag: I’m merely the victim here, seduced by your charms.</p>
<p>So she basically gives her a blowjob and they spend the next few hours doing it.</p>
<p>Later that day:</p>
<p>Mur: I can’t believe you made me do all those things! I can’t believe it!</p>
<p>Kag: Yes, it was a very productive day indeed.</p>
<p>Mur: And yet you show not the tiniest sign of shame!</p>
<p>A few minutes later they notice a commotion on the streets. Long story short, Kageaki is about to don his armor in order to save the day, but he suddenly stops and realizes that he’s already decided to leave behind all fighting. Starting again now would only cause him more pain due to the law of Muramasa. So instead, the two of them simply go home. That night, Muramasa asks Kageaki is he wants to go far away with him, to a place where the two of them could live in peace – and he agrees. However, she knows that such a place probably doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou521/" rel="attachment wp-att-2254"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2254" alt="maou521" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou521.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa realizes that as long as she’s with Kageaki, he won’t be free from his painful memories. As a Tsurugi, she constantly reminds him of the battlefield and all that he had lost.</p>
<p><em>I want to become something else – something that isn’t a Tsurugi. A being not of cold steel. Someone who has the right to embrace him and soothe his heart.</em></p>
<p>The next morning, they act upon their promise and go to the station to leave Kamakura.</p>

<p>Kag: There’s no need to hurry.</p>
<p>Mur: You’re right.</p>
<p><em>I’ve lived a fast-paced life these past two years. I pushed myself to the limit, barely allowing myself to even catch my breath.</em></p>
<p><em>All that changed now. There is no need to hurry anymore. My days of endless running are over. Not because I finally found inner peace, nor because I discovered true happiness. For I am not a hero would be rewarded with such things at the end of his long journey.</em></p>
<p><em>I am merely a sinner trying to escape from all his past crimes. I fully acknowledge that fact.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not deserve to be granted such peace. The past will continue to torment me till the day I die.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite all that… I need not hurry. Not any longer. I am allowed to walk down this path at my own pace.</em></p>

<p>Kag: Is this your first time riding a train?</p>
<p>Mur: Yes. Well, my first time riding it like a normal person.</p>
<p>Kag: Ah, I see. When we used the train, I always made you travel in the freight car… I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Mur: H-hey, what’s with the sudden apology? Geez.</p>
<p><em>I lost a great many of things. In its place, I gained nothing. Save for one thing – this one moment, right now: when I could finally flee from my sins and my past. The present is all I have. It is all I need.</em></p>
<p><em>I am content.</em></p>
<p><em>So let us embark on this journey.</em></p>
<p>Kag: The scenery visible from the train’s window is quite a pleasant sight.</p>
<p>Mur: Is that so?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou524/" rel="attachment wp-att-2251"><img alt="maou524" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou524.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Yes. Gazing at the vast landscape drifting on before your eyes has a certain magical quality to it. In any case, you’ll see for yourself once we board the train.</p>
<p>Mur: I’m looking forward to it!</p>
<p><em>I no longer have anything or anyone to chase after. All of that is behind me now. I stood there, merely looking at the nearby Muramasa. For no particular reason, she returned my gaze with a smile.</em></p>
<p><em>The sound of the nearby train’s steam whistle filled the station; it was the sign of something coming to an end, as well as of a new beginning.</em></p>
<p>And then… we hear a stabbing sound. We are then greeted by the following image:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou525/" rel="attachment wp-att-2250"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2250" alt="maou525" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou525.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa…?</p>
<p><em>Muramasa’s chest was pireced by the sharp steel of a blade.</em></p>
<p><em>A… sword?</em></p>
<p><em>Whose?</em></p>
<p>Sorimachi: Hey there! You’re looking as gloomy as ever. No, that’s not quite right. Recently, your wretchedness has reached a level that was sickening to even look at…! You hear me?! Minato…!!</p>
<p><em>Looking back on it… who was Minato Kageaki’s true enemy?</em></p>
<p><em>Suzukawa Ryoubu? Nagasaka Ukyou? Fuuma Koutaro? Ouji Suguru? Ouji Misao? George Gargett? Ashikaga Moriuji? Ashikaga Chachamaru? God? Minato Hikaru?</em></p>
<p><em>All the above risked their own lives to oppose Minato Kageaki. However… were they driven by genuine hostility?</em></p>
<p><em>They saw him as an obstacle and thus opposed him. Or they faced him just for sport. Some even loved him. They all had their own respective enemies and goals – to them, Minato Kageaki was not someone they hated from the bottom of their hearts.</em></p>
<p><em>So who remains? Who loathed Minato Kageaki the most?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou526/" rel="attachment wp-att-2249"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2249" alt="maou526" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou526.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a><em>“I’ll say it as many times as you want.

<p><em>“That kid, those sisters, each and every one of them! Saying that you didn’t want to do it, yet you murdered them all the same!”</em></p>
<p>[Background music: Yukki (PIAS) - "The Call"]</p>
<p><em>The promise birthed in that moment brought about by his Immelmann Turn… is now being fully realized.</em></p>
<p><em>The only true enemy I ever had… was Sorimachi ichizou.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Y-you…</p>
<p>Sor: Ahaha! Ahahahaha!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou527/" rel="attachment wp-att-2248"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2248" alt="maou527" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou527.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Carrying Muramasa, Sorimachi jumps atop one of the departing trains and in a few seconds, compeltely disappears from Kageaki’s vision.</p>
<p>Kageaki desperately runs after the train, knocking over several other civilians. He is finally held back by a nearby station attendant, and is forced on the ground.</p>
<p><em>I savored the bitter taste of this utter absurdity – how unreasonable this all was. Why?! Why is this happening to me? Why am I being forcibly held back during such a critical time?!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou528/" rel="attachment wp-att-2247"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2247" alt="maou528" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou528.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Out of my way! LET GO OF ME!</p>
<p><em>I’m running out of time! I can’t see the train anymore!</em></p>
<p>He wants to don his armor and calls for Muramasa… when it finally sinks in that she’s gone. He recalls that a master and his Tsurugi are connected telepathically, so he should be able to reach out to her. However, he gets no answer this time.</p>
<p><em>I swiftly discarded the ominous shadow creeping up on my soul. There’s no way. It simply cannot be true.</em></p>
<p>He tries to make his way to a bus to chase after the train, but the crowd pushes him back and the bus’s door slams shut before his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Why did it come to this? This is too absurd – too cruel to be true!</em></p>

<p>He rushes towards the next station.</p>
<p>Kag: Someone! Anyone! Did anyone see an old man with a cane, or a long-haired Emishi woman? Please, anyone!</p>
<p>Only one guy answers.</p>
<p>Man: I saw him. He was carrying a large box of sorts.</p>
<p>Kag: Where did he go?!</p>
<p>Man: Um… wait a second… he left the station and then… man, which way did he go again…?</p>
<p>Kag: Please, try to remember! Remember!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou531/" rel="attachment wp-att-2244"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2244" alt="maou531" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou531.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Man: Hey now. That’s no way to talk to someone you’re asking a favor of.</p>
<p>Kag: Whatever! Just tell me what you know! Where is Muramasa…!!</p>
<p><em>Uttering her name reminded me of how much I’ve lost.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p><em>She’s gone. A presence I’ve felt not too long ago isn’t here any longer. I was overcome by a tremendous feeling of loss.</em></p>
<p><em>I love her. </em></p>
<p><em>I long for her. </em></p>
<p><em>I need her.</em></p>
<p>The man has enough of Kageaki and leaves.</p>
<p><em>Why can’t he understand how important this is to me?! Why can’t he comprehend that I’m trying to save the woman I love?!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou532/" rel="attachment wp-att-2243"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2243" alt="maou532" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou532.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>Suguru: Why…? Why did it end up like this? I was so close to achieving my dream! I was finally able to climb out of that cesspit! Can you even comprehend how much I had to endure to get here?! Please, Minato! I beg of you… let me go!</em><br>
Kag: Please, wait a second! I beg of you…!</p>
<p>He then recognizes Sormiachi’s name scrawled upon a nearby bulletin board, along with a way to find him.</p>
<p>When then cut to Sorimachi and Muramasa (in spider form, recovering from her wound) on a field. Muramasa takes note of the fact that Sorimachi wasn’t the least bit surprised when he witnessed her transformation from Emishi back to spider. In other words, he knew she was a Tsurugi from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Mur: I don’t recall ever appearing before you in my human form, though…</p>
<p>Sor: Oh, I’ve seen you plenty of times from behind.</p>
<p>Mur: So you were following us?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou533/" rel="attachment wp-att-2242"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2242" alt="maou533" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou533.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Sor: Only this past week. I was quite surprised when I first noticed that bastard being accompanied by such a fine-looking Emishi woman as yourself. So that’s the one called Muramasa, I thought.</p>
<p>Then Muramasa thinks Sorimachi wants revenge against Kageaki for the murders of the two elf sisters. Sorimachi responds by basically saying that if he’s pissed about anything, it’s that Kageaki killed the two sisters and thus foiled his plans by stealing his “prey” from him. (If I remember correctly, Sorimachi was planning to kidnap the elf sisters or something similarly petty like that. I might have to go back to that chapter and check the script, it’s been a while.) Muramasa is astonished, and says that something like that barely counts as revenge, so in the end, he doesn’t seem to have any real reason to hate Kageaki so much.</p>
<p>Mur: I don’t know what you’re planning, but I do know that you harbor a deep hatred towards Kageaki. You know nothing about him. He’s suffered enough! If “Muramasa” is the one you hate, then hate me. I will not let you harm Kageaki. I want him to be free from all this!</p>
<p>Sor: You’re right – I don’t know much about the two of you. What I’m focused on is one thing only.</p>
<p>Mur: What?</p>
<p>Sor: No matter what happens, that bastard will never change. He’s still the same as he was back then.</p>
<p>Mur: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Sor: You must’ve seen how he shed tears after murdering those two sisters.</p>
<p>Sor: Muramasa – you told me you want him to be free, right?</p>
<p>Mur: Yes…</p>
<p>Sor: That simplifies things. In that case, you’ll just have to die.</p>
<p>Mur: ……..</p>
<p>He then draws his sword and swings down at Muramasa. The scene then fades to black.</p>
<p>We cut back to Kageaki’s point of view, who has just arrived at the same field.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:15px;font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Kag: Where is she?</span></p>
<p>Sor: To think we’d meet under such ugly circumstances after Enoshima… heh! Well, I actually saw that disgusting mug of yours several times from the shadows, but still…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou534/" rel="attachment wp-att-2241"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2241" alt="maou534" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou534.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kag: WHERE IS SHE?!</p>
<p>Sor: Aren’t you adorable, being so infatuated with her. Even though she’s just a mere Tsurugi, nothing more.</p>
<p>Kag: I don’t need to explain anything to you. Give her back to me.</p>
<p>Sor: And *I* don’t need to listen to your sentimental nonsense. Give her back, you say? Well, well… how would I go about doing that…?</p>
<p>Kag: You desire vengeance, do you not? I will do whatever you ask of me.</p>
<p>Sor: Anything? How cute. Aren’t you just a model of generosity. You idiot. What can you possibly do in your current state? Nothing.</p>
<p>Kag: What are you planning?! Why are you doing all this?!</p>
<p>Sor: Why indeed…? *cackles* I’ve already done what I wanted to.</p>
<p>Kag: What are you implying?</p>
<p>Sor: You have a brain in that thick skull of yours, don’t you? How about you try using it?</p>
<p>Kag: Answer me! Where is she?</p>
<p>Sor: She’s gone.</p>
<p>Kag: What are you trying to tell me?!</p>
<p>Sor: What, you suffered brain damage or something? Can’t you even understand something as simple as this?</p>
<p>Kag: ………..</p>
<p>Sor: I’ve already killed her. That’s what I was trying to tell you.</p>
<p><em>“I killed her.”</em></p>
<p><em>My mind was incapable of registering that single sentence.</em></p>
<p><em>This man, standing before me now… killed Muramasa.</em></p>
<p>Kag: You’re lying…</p>
<p>Sor: *insane cackle*</p>
<p>Kag: It can’t be true…</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p>Sorimachi then takes out a piece of crimson armor from his pocket and throws it in front of him.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou535/" rel="attachment wp-att-2240"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2240" alt="maou535" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou535.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>Master and Tsurugi are one soul, one steel. No matter how far apart they are, their minds will always connect, and their voices will always reach each other.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki finally realizes that Muramasa is gone for good, and loses his mind. Screaming, he charges at Sorimachi and the two begin fighting bare-handed.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou536/" rel="attachment wp-att-2239"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2239" alt="maou536" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou536.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Sor: Yes… just like that! That’s the expression I wanted!</p>
<p>Sor: You’re transparent. You hate me so much you want to kill me, right? I can tell. And that’s the way it should be.</p>
<p>Sor: Up until now, you’ve only killed against your will. You took a life and shed tears. You were pathetic. You should have just crawled into a hole to die, along with that cursed Tsurugi. And yet, you took on this mission, even though no one asked you to do so, and took countless lives thinking you were saving the world. You killed and killed and shed even more tears. Truly and utterly pathetic… you’re going around murdering others while licking your own wounds! You disgust me.</p>
<p>Sor: But now… you’re perfect. That’s the face I wanted to see. That’s the face of a monster who just wants to kill and kill and kill out of pure hatred, and nothing more. You should’ve been like this when you shed the blood of those sisters!</p>
<p><em>Shut up. I don’t want to hear another word from you.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet, the old man continued laughing.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki picks up a stone from the ground and is about to strike Sorimachi dead with it. We get a choice here. Basically: kill Sorimachi or not.</p>
<p>Let’s pick the “kill him” option for now.</p>
<p><img alt="maou537" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou537.jpg" width="584" height="327"></p>
<p>He smashes his skull in with a rock. His blood and brains splatter all over the place. With his last remaining strength, Sorimachi crawls to a neraby location and reveals the box he had hidden. He then dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou538/" rel="attachment wp-att-2237"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2237" alt="maou538" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou538.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki opens the box and finds Muramasa inside.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…!!</p>
<p>Mur: ………..</p>
<p><em>Why was she looking at me with such eyes?</em></p>
<p><em>Eyes that knew parting was imminent; a gaze that wanted to say farewell.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou539/" rel="attachment wp-att-2236"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2236" alt="maou539" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou539.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>I picked up the cane the old man had dropped. The cane that sheltered a blade within.</em></p>
<p><em>What am I doing?</em></p>
<p><em>I drew the blade from its sheath.</em></p>
<p><em>My limbs were forced into motion by an unknown force. Just like… that time.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the fate of one who murders out of hatred. The price paid by one who murders for love.</em></p>
<p><em>The counterbalance of good and evil.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou540/" rel="attachment wp-att-2235"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2235" alt="maou540" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou540.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>The hand that struck down Sorimachi Ichizou is now fated to take Muramasa’s life as well.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa…!! Get away from me!</p>
<p><em>She did not move.</em></p>
<p>Mur: ………….</p>
<p><em>The struggle of my mind is completely ignored by my body – it moves to obey that single, terrible law.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…!</p>
<p>Mur: It’s… okay. This is how it should be.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou541/" rel="attachment wp-att-2234"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2234" alt="maou541" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou541.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>I killed her.</em></p>
<p><em>The price of hatred is thus paid in the blood of a loved one.</em></p>
<p>Kag: No…!! Why did this have to happen?! WHY?!</p>
<p>Mur: Please, Midou… you have to forgive yourself. You’ve been robbed of everything now… down to the one last person you held dear. You have to stop… blaming yourself for everything…</p>
<p><em>I held her tightly in my embrace. With a final, barely audible breath, she begged me to forgive myself.</em></p>
<p><img alt="maou542" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou542.jpg" width="584" height="327"></p>
<p><em>And then… she shattered to pieces in my arms. Her final fragments, gently glittering in the light of the evening sun, soon dispersed into nothingness.</em></p>
<p><em>Only I remained, standing still as if frozen in the midst of the field.</em></p>
<p><em>With everything taken from me, I was finally set free.</em></p>
<p><em>No longer was I bound by the chains of duty, a curse, nor hatred…</em></p>
<p><em>…or love.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Muramasa's route END]</p>
<p>Okay, so we still have a True End to get through, so let’s go back and choose “I can’t kill him” this time.</p>
<p>Kageaki basically realizes that killing Sorimachi would serve no purpose. He remembers that everyone he’s killed up to now was done for a reason, for a greater good – in order to save a larger amount of people. However, murdering Sorimachi here wouldn’t accomplish anything. So he drops the stone and lets the old man live.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou543/" rel="attachment wp-att-2232"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2232" alt="maou543" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou543.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>He explains this to Sorimachi as well, and says that since the world is still in chaos, his goal of ending all conflict has not been accomplished yet.</p>
<p>Sor: Are you serious? And how the hell are you planning to do that? By sending everyone flowers and asking nicely to stop fighting?</p>
<p>Kag: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><em>Such a thing would be out of my reach. A murderer reeking of blood is hardly fit to convince others to stop fighting. That is someone else’s job. All that remains for me is my own way of doing things. My own, inferior method of dealing with things.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Eradicate conflict with as little sacrifices as possible.</p>
<p>Sor: ………</p>
<p>Kag: You have a problem with it?</p>
<p>Sor: No, not really… but are you planning to do that like you did before, bawling your eyes out while murdering others?</p>
<p>Kag: Sorimachi. I’m not sure you fully comprehend the situation.</p>
<p>Sor: Huh?</p>
<p>Kag: Nothing I’ve ever done was against my own will. If there’s something I don’t want to do, I don’t do it. If there’s something I want to do, I do it. Who would honestly do something that is against their will…? Nothing has changed since then. From now on as well… I will kill because I want to.</p>
<p>Sor: So why did you shed tears that day?</p>
<p>Kag: I did no such thing. And even if it appeared that way to you…</p>
<p>Sor: ……….</p>
<p>Kag: …in reality, I was laughing. Those must have been tears shed due to how much I was enjoying myself.</p>
<p>Sorimachi falls silent, and begins to cackle as usual.</p>
<p>Sor: What you’re doing is befitting of a true villain… a daemon.</p>
<p>Kag: I know.</p>
<p>Sor: Can you really see this through…? A spoiled brat like you?</p>
<p>Kag: I can. For I truly believe in the evil of my ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou544/" rel="attachment wp-att-2231"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2231" alt="maou544" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou544.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Sor: Keh… alright. Do as you like, then. And don’t forget to take her, as well.</p>
<p>Kag: ……..?</p>
<p>Sor: I’m giving her back to you.</p>
<p>So he reveals Muramasa to her, just like in the other “route” and then takes his leave.</p>
<p>As with Chachamaru’s ending, I recorded and translated/subbed this final scene as well, you can watch it below:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="584" height="359" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/d3BK0IqsY-w.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></span>
<p>Mur: Midou… are you really planning to continue this bloodshed? Are you truly content with that?</p>
<p>Kag: I am. I shall conquer the way of war itself, standing victoriously atop the world, lending my blade to all those who desire it.</p>
<p>Kag: Those who wish to be conquerors will surely covet my power. However, the price for such power will be paid in the blood of all they hold dear.&nbsp;All they wish to protect. Righteousness. Justice. I will rob them of all such things as compensation for slaying their enemies.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou545/" rel="attachment wp-att-2230"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2230" alt="maou545" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou545.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Such is the counterbalance of good and evil – death upon the wicked and the just. I shall spread its law across this land. And thus all of humanity will come to know it as the bitter truth that governs the battlefield, acknowledge it, and grow sick of it… until the day conflict itself dies out from the face of this earth.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou…</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa… Will you be at my side?</p>
<p>Mur: My name is Muramasa: a being birthed by the counterbalance of good and evil, its law engraved upon my heart of steel. More importantly… I am your Tsurugi. As long as my master desires power, I shall lend him my aid.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p><em>She extends a hand – I take hold of it. With her touch, I can feel my strength returning.</em></p>
<p><em>Clasping her hand, I make a silent vow:</em></p>
<p><em>That one day, after our goal had been accomplished, the two of us will pay the price as well. </em></p>
<p><em>A price paid in the blood of those we hold most dear: each other.</em></p>
<p>(So I’m assuming the part with the Warlords was the future? Because this scene heavily hints at the possibility of Kageaki going on to form the order and thus become the Warlord.)</p>
<p>We then briefly cut to Sorimachi, who happens to bump into Kanae and Ichijou on his way back.</p>
<p>Sorimachi: Ah… so you’re here.</p>
<p>Kanae: Indeed.</p>
<p>Sor: Well, it is as you’ve just witnessed. The question remains: how will you respond?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou546/" rel="attachment wp-att-2229"><img alt="maou546" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou546.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kanae: Well… I suppose I’ll merely watch over him for the time being. To see how far he can go. As far as my revenge is concerned… it can wait.</p>
<p>Sayo: Ohoho. Indeed.</p>
<p>Sor: What about you, Miss Ayane?</p>
<p>She heads off in the direction of Kageaki without answering him.</p>
<p>Sor: She’s off. As I thought.</p>
<p>Kanae: What about yourself, though?</p>
<p>Sor: Oh, I’m gonna head back to Kamakura. He… well, he’s matured into a splendid villain. There’s no need for me here any longer. I’m gonna return to my gang and continue business as usual. Now that the Shogunate’s in shambles, tough times will no doubt upon us…</p>
<p>Kanae: I see. Best of luck to you, then.</p>
<p>Sor: Well then, if you’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><em>The three part ways.</em></p>
<p><em>Sorimachi Ichizou leaves.</em></p>
<p><em>Ootori Kanae waits.</em></p>
<p><em>Ayane Ichijou presses on.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou547/" rel="attachment wp-att-2228"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2228" alt="maou547" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou547.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Back to Kageaki’s viewpoint. Ichijou finally catches up to him.</p>
<p><em>A stray gust of wind swept across the field. Blended into its windy embrace was a will so fierce, it boiled my skin. And so, I turned around.</em></p>
<p><em>A girl I knew all too well stood before me, showered by the rays of dusk and accompanied by a Tsurugi of deep indigo hue.</em></p>
<p><em>The gaze she threw at me was one heavy with anger, sorrow and determination.</em></p>
<p><em>Even without exchanging any words, I could feel the tension of an imminent battle.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/akki-end-ichijou/" rel="attachment wp-att-2304"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2304" alt="akki end ichijou" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/akki-end-ichijou.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p><em>I looked at her bitterly, my lips curling downwards.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>No, this will not do. </em></p>
<p><em>This is hardly the face of a villain about to plunge himself into battle. From this day on, I vowed to devote myself to the way of the battlefield: a path of my own choosing. There is no need to lament such a thing.</em></p>
<p><em>No, a villain’s expression should be akin to… indeed, something like this.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou549/" rel="attachment wp-att-2226"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2226" alt="maou549" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou549.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p><em>The enemy standing before me dons her armor. Chanting the sacred words of Muramasa, I do the same, letting my body be engulfed by her steel.</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>We cut back to the bridge, and the citizens and refugees arguing over its construction. However, Hikari interrupts them.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou550/" rel="attachment wp-att-2225"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225" alt="maou550" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou550.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Hikari: Please, don’t argue! Because to preserve, um, harmony… um…</p>
<p>Men: ……?</p>
<p>Hikari: To preserve, um… ah, that’s it, I remembered!</p>
<p>Hikari: <em>To preserve harmony among people is the most precious of all treasures!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou551/" rel="attachment wp-att-2224"><img alt="maou551" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou551.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>As Hikari smiles and looks up at the two men, we immediately cut to the fierce battle of Kageaki and Ichijou, almost as if it was an ironic answer to her statement. The song “Fuel My Soul” by Kazuhiro Watanabe plays during the scene.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193952/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-9-final/maou553/" rel="attachment wp-att-2222"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2223" alt="maou552" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou552.jpg" width="584" height="325"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2222" alt="maou553" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 9 (FINAL) _ gareblogs_files/maou553.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a>And with this, Full Metal Daemon Muramasa comes to an end.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>So THAT is the true end huh? Phew I thought Mur would die either way.<br>
Anyway I like it far more that Kag accepts Mur’s way and becomes a “villain” (basically like Ichijou in her end).</p>
<p>Thanks for all that, now up to the Fandisc! (I kid of course after all that you probably need a break).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Out of curiosity I read the final impressions of a Japanese blogger who beat the game, and she suggested that Kageaki becoming the Warlord at the end is actually the punishment he has been longing for. He will never be free from conflict, and is fated to do battle till the day he dies, without ever finding peace. Although it’s a path that he himself chose, you still can’t help but feel sorry for him. I think that’s a pretty interesting way of looking at it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This ending, I can’t really say even a part of what I thought about it. Kageaki really is the best protagonist I ever seen, or at least the most unique. How through punishing himself and at the same time trying to save the world from war on his own way. So that his necessary evil may one day end all wars.</p>
<p>And Muramasa is a great companion to Kageaki, when I thought that she died, I almost cried thinking that she didn’t deserve this.</p>
<p>Thanks for completing this long project, garejei. May I see you in your next one as well, hope it to be Janen-hen. XD</p>
