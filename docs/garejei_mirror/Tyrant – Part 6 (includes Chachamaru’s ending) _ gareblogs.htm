<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Tyrant</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Part 6</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This project is a fairly old work of mine, written and translated back in 2012, when I was still just starting out as a fan translator — as such, it’s not exactly the highest quality work I’ve ever put out, to say the least. I would’ve deleted it long ago, but since people still seem to be interested in it, I decided to keep it, but felt the need to give this quick warning beforehand.</p>

<p><em>We are being surrounded by an entire army of Rokuhara soldiers. And among the leaders of that army…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou2291.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1827" title="maou229" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou2291.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa gazes at Kageaki with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Oh, it is a fine night to hold an evening banquet out here. There’s really no need for you to come all the way to Fudaraku. We’re doing this right here, right now. We’ve heard it all from Raichou, you see. That you’re co-operating with the prince to overthrow the Shogunate…</p>
<p>Raichou: ……..!!</p>
<p>Cha: Oh, wait, that’s not right!</p>
<p>Kageaki: The prince is being targeted by those who would overthrow the Shogunate. The army you see here serves the purpose of guarding him for that very reason.</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, that’s right! Oh my, how could I have gotten it wrong? So don’t you worry, not a single hair of the prince will be harmed. We’re here to protect him, after all! From the likes of you.</p>
<p>(So basically what Kageaki said is just a pretense for them to crush Chief and co.)</p>
<p><em>Although this isn’t exactly how I planned it, I nonetheless managed to find Kageaki. Now, all that remains is for me to return him to his former self…!</em></p>
<p>Chachamaru: Think I’m gonna let you do as you please?</p>

<p>Cha: I thought you might be of use to me later on so I didn’t do anything to you, but you’ve ended up causing all sorts of trouble. I will not make that mistake again. You die tonight.</p>
<p>Cha: Raichou! You go and take care of that girlie over there with the Tsurugi. If the police chief makes a move, feel free to kill him as well. Kageaki, the guy dressed in black is all yours.</p>
<p>Kag: Understood.</p>
<p>Kageaki and Douji have a brief fight, with Kageaki coming out on top and wounding his legs. We then cut back to Muramasa vs. Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Mur: Give him back to me…</p>
<p>Cha: Huh?</p>
<p>Mur: Let go of my master!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou233.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1823" title="maou233" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou233.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Never! I’ve finally found a master that I could be of use to! I need him!</p>
<p>Mur: Like I care about any of that.</p>
<p>Cha: Oh, of course you don’t care. You know nothing about the agony of having to listen to the screams of that underground bastard 24 hours a day without a single moment of rest! No one knows. So I’ll just take back what’s mine with brute force!</p>
<p>They fight some more, and we cut back to Doujin vs. Kageaki once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou232.jpg"><img title="maou232" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou232.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Douji then, all of a sudden, reveals that he, too, has a Tsurugi, which he promptly dons. Chachamaru looks in their direction and is at a loss for words. Seeems like he wasn’t expecting Douji to be a Musha. And no matter how good Kageaki is, without an armor he can’t do much against a Tsurugi.</p>
<p>Douji: I owe my life to you… so, to repay that debt, I will not kill you here. However… you will have to part with that arm!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou234.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1822" title="maou234" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou234.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Cha: ……..!!</p>
<p>Muramasa blocks her path.</p>
<p>Cha: Out of my way!</p>
<p>Mur: I refuse. You did the very same thing a minute ago, but now the tables have turned.</p>
<p>Cha: But Kageaki will be killed at this rate! You wouldn’t want that!</p>
<p>Mur: Douji will not take his life. He will wound him, no doubt, but it’s nothing I can’t heal. Checkmate, Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Cha: You bitch…!</p>
<p>Back to Kageaki.</p>
<p><em>It appears that Chachamaru lost her composure because of something. No doubt she thinks I’ll be defeated by Douji, and that Muramasa will return my mental state to how it was before the change.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou235.jpg"><img title="maou235" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou235.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p><em>Needless concerns, all of them. Muramasa lacks the power to change me back. In her current state, she is inferior to the Ginseigou – in other words, she shouldn’t be able to remove her corruption. In addition to that, the Ginseigou’s influence is in itself a destructive force. Shattering a mind to pieces and joining the broken pieces back together are two different things. And the latter is, without a doubt, much more difficult a task compared to the former.</em></p>
<p><em>She cannot save those who have been affected by the Ginseigou. It’s utterly impossible. Even during our time in that prison cell, shortly after she refused my offer to reconcile our differences, she attempted to sway my mind and failed miserably. After all, that technique is forbidden to her.</em></p>
<p>Flashback:</p>
<p><em>Emperor: You are forbidden to use that accursed art. Should a time arise when you would resort to it… at that moment, you stop being a subject of mine and will become a traitor to this land.</em></p>
<p><em>To a person who lived in the middle ages, such an order from the Emperor is absolute.</em></p>
<p><em>Simply put, there is no need to worry. She might attempt it regardless, but I will make sure that it never comes to that.</em></p>
<p>He then faces Douji’s Tsurugi, fully aware of how foolish it is for a human to fight a Musha.</p>
<p>Instead, he just laughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou236.jpg"><img title="maou236" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou236.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p><em>What point is there to fighting a Musha like this? No matter how fast I move, I will never be able to overcome him. No matter how much strength I pour into my blade, it will all be futile against his thick, panzer-like armor. A laughable delusion, nothing more.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Ahaha…. haha…</p>
<p><em>For example, that steel helmet of his. Slicing it clean in half with a single strike… is impossible. Irrational! The height of insanity! It isn’t something mere humans can accomplish!</em></p>
<p>Several images flash at the screen:</p>

<p>Douji: H-how… could this be…? I-im… impossible…</p>
<p>Kag: Ahahaha… hahahahaha!!</p>
<p>He cuts off Douji’s right arm and continues laughing.</p>
<p><em>I cannot help but laugh at all this. My past self who was so worried about the principle of the empty mind seems utterly comical to me now.</em></p>
<p><em>Ahh…! To think it was so simple! Casting all worldly thoughts aside and becoming one with the steel in my hands is laughably easy! To think a true daemon’s blade could be wielded by such simple means…!</em></p>
<p><em>It feels good. Casting aside all emotions save for my undying love of Hikaru makes me feel complete.</em></p>
<p>Cha: *mouth open, gazing at Kageaki in disbelief*</p>
<p>Mur: It can’t be… th-this is the very same thing he did at Enoshima…!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou243.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1815" title="maou243" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou243.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>(Look up Chapter 4 in case you don’t remember.)</p>
<p>Raichou: That man is a monster…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: What’s with the surprised expression, Chachamaru? Have you forgotten that I was the one who taught Hikaru how to wield a blade?</p>
<p>After a few seconds, Chief himself stands in front of Kageaki, wielding the discarded blade of Douji.</p>
<p><em>Kikuchi Akitaka. A man once known as Minato Akitaka.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou244.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1814" title="maou244" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou244.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Akitaka: This was the second time, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p>Kag: …….?</p>
<p>Akitaka: The second time you did that.</p>
<p>Kag: Yes, you are correct. Not unlike all those years ago.</p>
<p>Aki: I was the one who broke you back then. It is all my fault. However… I cannot allow you to continue on, broken like this. Submit yourself to Muramasa’s influence and return to how you used to be, Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kag: Return to how I used to be…? Are you even aware of the weight your words carry?! Kikuchi Akitaka!! Who will love her, if not me! Subaru is long gone! And you… you discarded her years ago!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou246.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1813" title="maou246" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou246.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Well, whatever. I care not for your nonexistent love. Nor will I condemn you. Go and flee like a dog to wherever you please… but don’t you dare stand in my way!</p>
<p>Their blades clash.</p>
<p>Kag: I will love Hikaru, if no one else will! I will never abandon her! All those who stand in my way shall perish! No matter who it is!</p>
<p>Aki: *sigh* Kageaki… what you’re feeling right now is hardly love. It is merely a curse of your own doing.</p>
<p>Kag: Silence!</p>
<p>They are then interrupted by a random Rokuhara soldier who brings a report of an unexpected GHQ attack, and tells Kageaki and the others to return to Fudaraku ASAP.</p>
<p>We then cut to Wolf and Clive. They worry about their higher ups changing their minds about Yamato and not authorizing the deployment of the bomb to destroy Fudaraku. So basically, due to Wolf’s suggestion, they decide to simply attack the Rokuhara head on – once they’re already fighting, it’s going to become a matter of honor and saving face to achieve victory (it’s a holy crusade , etc.), and eventually they’ll be allowed to use extreme measures like the bomb.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou251.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1808" title="maou251" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou251.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki and Chachamaru are afraid of the same thing – for them, the bomb is necessary for their Hikaru-related plans, as we’ve already discussed. So basically they’re prepared to protect Fudaraku and fight the GHQ for as long as possible, in order to force them to use up as many troops and resources as possible – this will in turn force them to rely on the bomb. As it turns out, it is now the 30th of November, and Hikaru -according to Chachamaru- is “scheduled” to awaken as the Ginseigou on the 4th of December.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m gonna summarize quite a bit of dialogue now, because 90% of it are military discussions and fighting.</p>
<p>Basically, the GHQ is attacking from the sea, using the southern coastline. Two large batallions are heading towards Fudaraku Castle, and Chachamaru and co. are preparing to hold their ground against them until reinforcements from Shishiku arrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou253.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1806" title="maou253" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou253.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Chaos sweeps across the land, with desperate reports coming in from all the different areas asking for immediate assistance against the invading GHQ forces.</p>
<p>A couple of Rokuhara Tsurugi attempt to take on the large flying ship controlled by the GHQ (the one from Kanae’s route), but are shot down by the special stealth troops of the GHQ, also seen in Kanae’s route (basically TSurugi that are capable of turning invisible via a cloaking system) Chief and prince discuss the severity of the situation while GHQ forces move in to Kamakura and assure tthe citizens to stay indoors while they save them from the oppression of the Rokuhara Shogunate. Douji and Ichijou are busy recovering due to the wounds they received in the previous battle, while Muramasa is out on the streets moping and thinking about Kageaki.</p>

<p>She comes close to Fudaraku and sees that there’s an all-out war going on between the GHQ and the Rokuhara. Later that day, Raichou and his troops attack the GHQ airship and prove to be successful. Day turns to afternoon, and afternoon to night.</p>
<p>Kageaki is looking at all the soldiers being carried out on stretchers.</p>
<p>Kag: The stench of death is everywhere.</p>
<p>Cha: This is just the beginning. More and more people will die from now on. And in the end… everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou258.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1801" title="maou258" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou258.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>The next morning, there’s a loudspeaker transmission from the GHQ to the Rokuhara. The GHQ announces that Koga (Sasagawa, where they’re expecting Shishiku’s help from) has fallen, and therefore no Rokuhara reinforcements will ever arrive to help Fudaraku. They demand the immediate surrender of the Rokuhara forces. Chachamaru gives out an order to all nearby officers to spread the word that the GHQ message was just a bluff, in order to keep up the morale. However, she whispers to Kageaki that they probably weren’t lying about the fall of Koga. Therefore, Kageaki and Chachamaru are now in deep shit.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou259.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1800" title="maou259" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou259.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>We’re back with Muramasa, who, after failing to get inside Fudaraku, is wandering the streets again.</p>
<p><em>I couldn’t get close to Fudaraku Castle. Sneaking in under cover of darkness was also out of the question. Nighttime patrols are thorough during war time, making any such attempts even more dangerous. Frankly speaking, there was nothing I could do.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou260.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1799" title="maou260" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou260.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: This isn’t the time to be complaining, though…</p>
<p><em>I’ve been to the battlefield several times during my life when I accompanied my grandfather. I’ve seen enough of war to be able to predict the outcome of this one. The castle will eventually fall. I could no doubt infiltrate the building during the chaos and confusion that would ensue. However, searching for one person under such circumstances would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In other words, I have to find Kageaki before it comes to that.</em></p>
<p>She continues walking and turns into an abandoned street and comes across a man whose walking is a bit funny, like he was drunk or something. A military vehicle is coming his way, and it’s only thanks to Muramasa’s intervention that he’s not hit.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou261.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1798" title="maou261" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou261.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Man: A-ah…</p>
<p>Muramasa: Don’t you just “ah” me! If you can’t even keep your balance, you have no place taking a walk out here on the streets! Unless getting hit by a car was your original intention, go back to your home right this instant!</p>
<p>Man: A-ah, so that was a car… Thank you for help, miss.</p>
<p>Muramasa: ………?</p>
<p><em>Overcome by an uncomfortable feeling, I took a good look at the face of the young man I’ve just helped.</em></p>
<p>Man: Oh? Was “miss” not appropriate, by any means? That’s odd. It should be a generally accepted term by women of all ages, not to mention that it can be used with strangers as well, making it an all-purpose word with no drawbacks. It usually works like magic~</p>
<p>Man: Or could it be that the voice I’ve just heard belongs to a young man who’s rather skillful at imitating a woman? Please don’t tell me if I’m right or not. Having to come to terms with such a painful truth might be bad for my weak heart, you see.</p>
<p>Muramasa: *gasp* Inagi… Tadayasu?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou262.jpg"><img title="maou262" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou262.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Tadayasu: O-oh, so you’re an acquaintance of mine? I’m so sorry, it’s hard to tell now that I’m like this… I don’t believe I recognize your voice, though. Would you mind telling me your name, please?</p>
<p>Mur: A-ah… actually, I don’t think you know me. We probably haven’t even talked yet until today. I just happened to know who you were.</p>
<p>Tadayasu: Oh, I see. Sorry for causing you trouble that one time.</p>
<p>Mur: Trouble? That time?</p>
<p>Tada: A-ah, this is just a sort of repeating pattern for me. I always go around being all happy-go-lucky and causing all sorts of trouble for the townsfolk without even realizing it. At least, I used to be like that until recently…</p>
<p>Mur: Oh… d-don’t worry, you didn’t cause me any sort of trouble.</p>
<p>Tadayasu: Ah, I see. Well, that’s a rarity. In any case, thank you for what you did earlier. If you weren’t there I probably would’ve died… that would’ve been unfortunate.</p>
<p>Mur: Yes. And oh, um, it wasn’t anything special… so no need to thank me…</p>
<p>Tadayasu: No, no, you have to properly say thanks to those who help you. That’s what my friends would always do, in any case. They’re… well… they’re gone now. Due to various circumstances.</p>
<p>Mur: ……….</p>
<p>Tada: Which is exactly why I have to treasure their memories. You’re right, it would’ve been really unfortunate if I had died back there. There would be no one left to carry on his will. There’s no way I can allow myself to die like this…</p>
<p>Mur: ……….</p>
<p>Tada: P-pardon me, I said something strange.</p>
<p>Mur: About that friend of yours… is he…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou263.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796" title="maou263" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou263.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Tada: Yes. He got caught up in something and lost his life. However, I believe that he died *for* us. It probably wouldn’t have made any difference if I or Konatsu died… and yet, he was the one chosen. Not because he did anything bad… quite the opposite. He was the strongest and bravest in our group. I think… he sacrificed himself so we could live.</p>
<p><em>The young man uttered those words, oblivious of how dangerously close they were to the truth.</em></p>
<p>Tada: So I’ll have to live on, for his sake as well. And I need to look after Konatsu. It was my fault that Yuuhi died, so it’s the least I can do.</p>
<p><em>You’re wrong. It’s not your fault that he died. It’s mine. All of it.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa then offers to escort him home after he reveals that he’s sort of lost.</p>
<p>Eventually, the military car from before returns and goes around in circles, trying to hit Muramasa and Tadayasu at each turn. Mostly because they’re douchebags like that. Muramasa concludes that he could easily flee if it was only her, but now Tadayasu is also here.</p>
<p>Muramasa: *thinking* If Kageaki was here… I’m sure he wouldn’t leave him here to die. So neither will I.</p>
<p><em>I firmly embraced that single thought.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Inagi Tadayasu. I have a question for you. Have you ever flown among the clouds?</p>
<p>Tadayasu: E-eh?</p>
<p>Muramasa: Let me show you what it’s like.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou264.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1795" title="maou264" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou264.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>She takes him in her arms and jumps up several metres. The drivers of the car look up a them in disbelief, and promptly crash into the wall.</p>
<p>Tada: Y-you… just did something really amazing, didn’t you?</p>
<p>Mur: Maybe~</p>
<p>Tada: We really were up there in the sky!</p>
<p>Mur: Wouldn’t that be quite the miracle~</p>
<p><em>I threw a wink at the young man, lamenting the fact that he saw nothing of it.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, the two soldiers open fire at them and Muramasa takes three of their bullets to protect Tadayasu.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou265.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1794" title="maou265" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou265.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a></p>
<p>She releases her steel webs and defeats them easily enough. However, soon enough Tsurugi-clad soldiers appear before them, no doubt drawn here by the sound of gunshots. Muramasa is, however, determined not to abandon Tadayasu.</p>
<p>Tada: Miss…</p>
<p>Muramasa: If you’re planning to tell me to escape alone, I’ll hear none of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou266.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1793" title="maou266" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou266.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Tada: I’d like to ask you something. Just one question.</p>
<p>Mur: Go on.</p>
<p>Tada: Are you… are you the one who killed Yuuhi?</p>
<p><em>At that moment, I lost sight of the entire world around me.</em></p>
<p>Mur: H-huh…?</p>
<p>Tada: You did, didn’t you.</p>
<p>Mur: ………</p>
<p>Mur: Yes.</p>
<p><em>I admitted it. I’m certain Kageaki would’ve done the same in this situation.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Tad: I knew it. It just suddenly came to me, actually. I was wondering why a young lady like you would go out of her way to save me…</p>
<p>Mur: Don’t you… detest me?</p>
<p>Tad: I do. Yuuhi was an irreplaceable&nbsp;friend to me. I resent you more than anything for taking him away from me.</p>
<p><em>I knew I was on the verge of death, regardless of whether or not we were surrounded by enemy soldiers.</em></p>
<p><em>A Tsurugi’s steel is immortal. Yet her heart can decay, her soul can die.</em></p>
<p><em>Inagi Tadayasu’s words pierced me with a strength that could shatter even my immortal steel.</em></p>
<p><em>I parted my lips once again, adding fuel to the fire that I knew would consume my very soul.</em></p>
<p>Mur: You’ll never be able to forgive me, won’t you.</p>
<p>Tada: Never.</p>
<p><em>I’m dying.</em></p>
<p>Tada: No matter how much you try to make it right, no matter how much you apologize… I will not forgive you.</p>
<p><em>I’m fading.</em></p>
<p>Tada: I will detest you till the day I die.</p>
<p><em>With every question I asked, my heart was hurrying towards its own demise.</em></p>

<p>Mur: Do you… desire revenge?</p>
<p>Tad: I do not.</p>
<p>Mur: W-why?</p>
<p>Tad: Because it would make Yuuhi’s death meaningless. You killed him for a reason, didn’t you?</p>
<p>Mur: W-well…</p>
<p>Tad: I don’t want to hear the reasons behind his death. But there must’ve been one… something his life had to be sacrificed for. And I’m sure it was very important to you. So at the very least… I want you to hold onto it – to treasure it.</p>
<p><em>It was only natural. Those who murder a human being must bear the weight of that sin till the end of their days.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Inagi Tadayasu…</p>
<p>Tad: That is all I’m asking of you.</p>
<p>Before she can answer, the three enemy Tsurugi around them quickly fly away.</p>
<p>Mur: Wh-what?</p>
<p>Tad: They must’ve received urgent orders… asking for reinforcements, if I heard it correctly.</p>
<p>We cut to Shishiku’s airship. The cavalry has arrived.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou268.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1791" title="maou268" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou268.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Soldier: Your Excellency, we’re about to enter the airspace of Kamakura.</p>
<p>Shishiku: Good. How is Fudaraku?</p>
<p>Soldier: The castle has yet to fall. However, they are fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>Shishiku: I see.</p>
<p>Back to Clive and Willow (eyepatch guy).</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou269.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1790" title="maou269" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou269.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Willow: The reinforcements from Sasagawa have arrived?! H-how is this possible? We’ve already taken control of Koga!</p>
<p>Clive reassures him that it’s only one ship. It might slow down their progress, but it’s not going to endanger it, he claims.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Aha… haha! It’s Shishiku! He came, after all!</p>
<p>The GHQ soldiers fly out to meet Shishiku’s ship and his soldiers, but are defeated by them. Shishiku’s men are in possession of a weapon that is capable of long-distance firing, so they’re basically sniping the GHQ soldiers, picking them off one by one.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou270.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1789" title="maou270" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou270.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou271.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1788" title="maou271" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou271.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Chachamaru concludes that the times are changing, and the era of heroes who fought directly on the battlefield is slowly coming to an end.</p>
<p>The fighting continues on, and we skip ahead to the night of December 3. Chachamaru and Kageaki are wondering if they’ll be able to last one more day until Hikaru’s awakening. She also says that the GHQ is guaranteed to use the bomb on the 4th. At least Wolf will make sure that it happens.</p>
<p>We then cut to Willow, Wolf and Clive. Willow and Wolf are excitedly discussing their future plans. They wish to make use of the bomb, but they have no permission to do so from the higher ups. Wolf suggest they just take the bomb without permission and use it anyway. Willow agrees and the two of them continue their agitated talk about the birth of a new world and all that jazz. Clive stands nearby, silently disapproving of all of this. He thinks that Wolf is a dangerous influence on Willow, and that he should’ve dispatched him while he still had the chance.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou272.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1787" title="maou272" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou272.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Their meeting is then interrupted by Kanae and Sayo. And a green haired dude referred to as “the count”. His actual name is Ruby Sachant, or something along those lines. He’s apparently a higher officer, a vice-executive of sorts at the League of Nations, and has come to take up his new post here in Yamato, gaining full authority. Seems like the League has had enough of the GHQ in Yamato doing as it pleases.</p>
<p>Willow: Please return to Yokohama! We’re here to carry out a sacred mission for Her Majesty the Queen! Just give me three… no, two more days, and I will crush the Rokuhara Shogunate!</p>
<p>Ruby: There is no need for that. Do you understand why Captain Ootori is with me?</p>
<p>Willow: ………<br>
<img title="maou273" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou273.jpg" width="584" height="325"><br>
<img title="maou274" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou274.jpg" width="584" height="323"></p>
<p>Ruby: She’s been serving under me from the very beginning. The very reason she was in the GHQ is because of that. She’s not alone, though. There are others, here and there, all gathering information in secret. I merely put the pieces of the puzzle together, and upon gazing at the complete picture… I’ve come to a conclusion – that you secretly dream of a new nation: a land of the free, home of the brave.</p>
<p>(Basically, Willow’s plan was to destroy the Rokhuara, and take complete control of Yamato *without* submitting himself to the authority of the Queen and the League, creating his own independent nation.)</p>
<p>Ruby: You’ve already attempted it in the past, and failed every single time. You realized you lacked in power… and in Tsurugi. So you decided to establish a new nation here in Yamato, where the conditions for creating Tsurugi are the most favorable. Hmpf. A foolish ambition.</p>
<p>Willow: You think I would give it all up after coming this far, you lapdog?!</p>
<p>He takes out a handgun and points it at Ruby.</p>
<p>Ruby: I see. So that is your answer.</p>
<p>Willow shoots, but Kanae dons her Tsurugi and deflects the bullet.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou275.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1784" title="maou275" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou275.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Ruby: Sorry for making you do this, Captain. However, I will have to be the one to end this. He is a man I once called a friend, even though he himself might not have realized it.</p>
<p>Ruby: Farewell, dear friend.</p>
<p>He shoots Willow dead, while Kanae arrests both Clive and Wolf.</p>
<p>The scene ends, and we skip to the 4th of December.</p>
<p>Jouan informs Kageaki and Chachamaru of everything that happened to Willow, Clive and Wolf. Chachamaru is outraged, knowing that with the League of Nations in control via Ruby, the bomb will not be dropped. Kageaki concludes that the only thing left to do is to rescue Clive and hope for the best with ih expertise.</p>
<p>Kageak: I’m going.</p>
<p>Cha: W-what? You?!</p>
<p>Kageak: Is there anyone else who could do it?</p>
<p>Cha: W-well… but it’s gonna be dangerous!</p>
<p>Kageaki: We’re in the middle of war. Everywhere is dangerous.</p>
<p>Cha: You aren’t going up against just one or two armored soldiers, you know! Who knows how many of them are there?</p>
<p>Kageak: I’ll think of something.</p>
<p>Cha: No! You’re not going.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your permission matters little to me. I said I’m going.</p>
<p>Cha: N-nooo~~!</p>
<p>She clings onto him, not wanting to let him go.</p>
<p>Cha: I’m going with you!</p>
<p>Kag: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p>They bicker for a bit, then:</p>
<p>Jouan: Lieutenant Minato. Please, leave this matter to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou276.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1783" title="maou276" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou276.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Jouan…?</p>
<p>Jouan: In fact, I was planning to do this from the start. In addition, I do not believe you excel at infiltration to the extent that I do.</p>
<p>Kag: Very well. Yagyuu Jouan – frankly, I care not whether you live or die. Hoever, if you’re going to die, at least make it worth something.</p>
<p>Jouan: Very well. No need to worry. For I had a revelation that I am being pulled towards my inevitable fate.</p>
<p>He then leaves.</p>
<p>Cha: Why did he say something like that…?</p>
<p>Kag: ……..</p>
<p>Kag: Somehow, I have a feeling that we won’t be seeing him ever again.</p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>We cut to the GHQ base and a discussion between Ruby and Kanae.</p>
<p>Kanae suggests that using the bomb would be the easiest way to end the war, and Ruby agrees… however, he refuses to do it. He says that ending the war like that would win them the hatred of the people of Yamato, and they would eventually rise up again in a few decades at the latest. In the end, they come to a conclusion and decide that they will retreat and organize a ceasefire agreement through the prince.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou277.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1782" title="maou277" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou277.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Back in Kamakura, Muramasa sees that the GHQ forces are withdrawing, and realizes that this is her chance to infiltrate Fudaraku Castle and thus get close to Kageaki. So she runs off, doing just that.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou278.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1781" title="maou278" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou278.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>We then cut to Clive being rescued by Jouan and Wolf. The three of them make their way to Ruby’s office and Clive promptly shoots him dead. A few minutes later Kanae enters the room to find the three of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou279.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1780" title="maou279" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou279.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou280.jpg"><img title="maou280" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou280.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Jouan stands in front of Kanae, about to strike her down, but Sayo urges her to flee, saying that he’s not an opponent she can take on. Kanae obeys her, but turns back for one more thing:</p>
<p>Kanae: Sayo! I do hope you’re aware of the duty a follower has to her master! You’ll be arranging my funeral, reading my epitaph and taking care of the inheritance! I expect you to carry out all three tasks in good health!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou281.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1778" title="maou281" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou281.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Then she runs off.</p>
<p>Sayo: Oh my. Just how long does she think I’m going to live?</p>
<p>Jouan: Forever and ever. You will continue to live for decades, centuries, millennia even – till the grains in this world’s hourglass move, you will not perish. Is that not right, my blood-stained countess?</p>
<p>Sayo: ……….</p>
<p>Jouan: You have not changed at all after 30 years… Still as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p>Sayo: Unlike you, Koshirou. *You* have changed quite a bit.</p>
<p>J: Indeed…</p>
<p>Sayo: What brings you here today, if I may ask?</p>
<p>J: My faith. For I have nothing else left.</p>
<p>Sayo: You truly have changed.</p>
<p>J: Indeed. I was robbed of many things.</p>
<p>Sayo: ………<br>
J: I am not the same man who fought by your side as a comrade. Not any longer. I resent no man, for I have cast aside all in this world of my own free will. My faith is all that remains. Everything else turned to ashes in my soul. Everything… save for God.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou282.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1777" title="maou282" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou282.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Sayo: I failed to soothe your heart all those years ago… and now, God remains your only hope…?</p>
<p>Jouan: Indeed… And yet, the one single memory I have not been able to cast away for good… is you.</p>
<p>Sayo: ……….</p>
<p>J: I could never bring myself to forget you.</p>
<p>Sayo: Koshirou…</p>
<p>Jouan: My earlier premonition was no lie. It appears that fate had indeed brought me here for a reason… I will defeat you, here and now! For it is the only path that can lead me towards God!</p>
<p>The two clash, and the scene ends.</p>
<p>We cut to Hikaru’s room, who closes her eyes and falls asleep. And then awakens once again as “Hikaru”.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou283.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1776" title="maou283" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou283.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou284.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1775" title="maou284" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou284.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Her bones are breaking as she stands up, indicating that her body is already beyond its limits, but it’s something she’s already gotten used to, the narration tells us.</p>
<p>She then notices some food next to her bed. After some hesitation, thinking that it might be someone else’s meal, she concludes that it must’ve been prepared for her, and begins eating.</p>
<p>Hikaru: …..!</p>
<p><em>The taste was all too familiar. The spices touching her lips brought with them memories of a certain someone.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Kageaki… you prepared this for me, didn’t you…</p>
<p>Energized by that thought, she quickly wolfs down the food and runs out of the room with a smile on her face, calling Muramasa.</p>
<p>Muramasa 2: Oh? You seem to be in good spirits today.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou285.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1774" title="maou285" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou285.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: Indeed! I’m full of energy!</p>
<p><em>The sky was heavy with a premonition of things to come. It told her that the fighting had already begun – a dance of countless men against each other, bodies pressing against bodies in a clash of souls. A festival that would conclude with the ascension of one, true ruler.</em></p>
<p>She dons Muramasa and shoots up at the sky.</p>
<p><em>Ahh…!</em></p>
<p><em>Today’s dream will surely end up being a sweet one.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou286.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1773" title="maou286" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou286.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>(The dialogue of Shishiku and Doushin below is mostly abbreviated.)</p>
<p>Rokuhara soldier: There’s something odd going on down on &nbsp;the ground… is it because of this song?</p>
<p>Soldier: Look! Both GHQ and the Rokuhara are killing each other without discrimination…!</p>
<p>The Rokuhara Tsurugi then transform into silver ones and attack their comrades. Chachamaru reveals it was her doing – she implanted eggs into their armors beforehand.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou288.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1771" title="maou288" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou288.jpg" width="584" height="330"></a></p>
<p>Chachamaru: Farewell, Shishiku…</p>
<p>We cut to Shishiku’s troops up in the sky.</p>
<p>Shishiku: So… my luck has finally run out. How fitting that a man like me, who ascended to his current rank through blood and betrayal, would be betrayed in the end by her own comrade.</p>
<p>Soldier: Your Excellency! Please, give the order to withdraw!</p>
<p>Shishiku: Withdraw? Are you cowards? Remember that rebel – Okabe. When surrounded by us, did he plead for his life? Did he attempt to flee? No. My luck has run out – so what? Regret is for the afterlife! As long as I draw breath, I will keep on fighting till the very end!</p>

<p>Back to Fudaraku.</p>
<p>Doushin explains to Raichou what’s going on.</p>
<p>Doushin: Well then, it seems like my time to take to the skies has come. I will treat this silver demon to a banquet it will never forget.</p>
<p>Raichou: B-but, Lord Doushin!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou290.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1769" title="maou290" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou290.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Doushin: Worry not, Raichou. I shall end it without breaking a sweat. I expect you to prepare some good sake for my return, for we will need it as we feast on the silver monster’s decapitated head! Ahahahahaha!!</p>
<p>Back to Muramasa, who’s near the castle, being surrounded by a bunch of berserk troops. She is eventually helped out by Kanae, who shoots all the soldiers dead in her Tsurugi.</p>

<p>Mur: Ootori… Kanae?</p>
<p>Kanae: Correct! I do wonder just what I’m doing here, helping you…</p>
<p>Mur: I have to thank you, though.</p>
<p>Kanae: Oh, it was nothing. I merely did it on a whim. But still… why did I decide to save *you* of all people…? It’s a mystery even to me…</p>
<p>(If you read Kanae’s route, you know very well what she means here.)</p>
<p>So Kanae basically helps Muramasa get into Fudaraku, after which she decides to stay behind.</p>
<p>Kanae: Oh, one more thing. I’d like you to pass on a message to Kageaki. Tell him that the GHQ is about to use the bomb. And the only way to prevent that from happening… is to destroy the Rokuhara Shogunate. Ashikaga Shirou Kuniuji is the key.</p>
<p>Then we cut back to Kageaki and Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Kageaki: So… is this the end?</p>
<p>Cha: It is. Everything is slowly coming to a close. And thus begins the age of God. A pefect world, governed by complete silence and stillness. A limitless force is now rampaging out there. Soon, another powerful force will come to meet it, and the 150 kilometre thick wall separating us from God shall come crumbling down.</p>

<p>Kag: ……..</p>
<p>Cha: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Kag: I was merely thinking. We’re planning to summon God and use it for our own needs. But what about the god itself – what will it do, when it is finally summoned?</p>
<p>Cha: Who knows.</p>
<p>They’re interrupted by Muramasa, who quickly shoots out her steel web, momentarily trapping Chachamaru in it.</p>
<p>Cha: A-argh! Kageaki! Run! Don’t get close to him!</p>
<p>Kag: Hmpf. You worry too much.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou…</p>
<p>Kag: Why are you here?</p>
<p>Mur: To heal you.</p>
<p>Kag: I don’t need your treatment. Now get out of my sight.</p>
<p>Mur: Never.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou294.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765" title="maou294" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou294.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Oh? A Tsurugi refusing to obey her master…?</p>
<p>Mur: My master is Minato Kageaki. Not you.</p>
<p>Kag: So you’re trying to tell me I’m not Kageaki?</p>
<p>Mur: Yes. If you were…</p>
<p>She then gestures towards the utter chaos and destruction around her.</p>
<p>Mur: …you wouldn’t just be standing here. You would fight to your last breath to put an end to this madness. Even if it was futile, you would try regardless!</p>
<p>Kag: You’re right. That’s what my former self would have done. So what?</p>
<p>Mur: Just what is it that you’re planning…?</p>
<p>So he tells her.</p>
<p>Mur: But Hikaru is the Ginseigou! That silver demon! You’re willing to do this even if the world itself will be destroyed in the process?!</p>
<p>Kag: Of course. The world can burn for all I care. As long as Hikaru remains alive in it.</p>
<p>Mur: You say that without a single shred of hesitation… your mind is too clear, completely devoid of worries or anxieties.</p>
<p>Kag: What are you trying to say?</p>
<p>Mur: You aren’t Minato Kageaki anymore. I’m certain of that.</p>
<p>Kag: I *am* Minato Kageaki. The one and only.</p>
<p>He then talks a bit about how Muramasa tried to use her contamination skill on her back in the cell ages ago, but it didn’t work then, so it’s not gonna work now, either.</p>
<p>Kag: You tried to command me, and failed. An imperial command is a bothersome little thing, is it not? His words carry weight even in this age. It truly is working in my favor.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou295.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1764" title="maou295" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou295.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Mur: ……..</p>
<p>Kag: Now get lost before Chachamaru frees herself and attacks you. You can’t do anything against me here, so there is no reason for you to remain. Get out of my sight and slumber for another five hundred years!</p>
<p>Mur: You’re mistaken about one thing.</p>
<p>Kag: ……..?</p>
<p>Mur: The reason I failed to control you back then wasn’t due to the imperial command. It is true that the word of the emperor carries weight still. But the real reason I could not control you that time… was because I truly did not wish to rob you of your own self!</p>
<p>Mur: This time, it’s going to be different. For you have no will of your own any longer. It’s true that your desire to save Hikaru is genuine… but you’re much more than that single emotion! Can’t you see that you’re being robbed of your very own consciousness?!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou296.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1763" title="maou296" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou296.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Mur: I will return all of it to you. It’s my duty as your Tsurugi!</p>
<p>Kag: A-aaahh!</p>
<p>Mur: Midou. I will not force anything on you. I will merely return everything that you have been robbed of.</p>
<p>Mur: Remember how you loved Hikaru. How important she was to you. And yet, you fought her time and again. Why is that? The reason is because there was something else you treasured.</p>
<p>Kag: Silence! Hikaru is the only family I have left! What else is there for me?!</p>
<p>Mur: That’s right – she’s all you have left. Save for her, your world was filled only with strangers.</p>
<p>Mur: Even so, you fought your own sister for a reason. You opposed her because you couldn’t possibly allow those strangers to succumb to pointless violence and have their own loved ones taken from them… That’s why you opposed Hikaru!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou297.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1762" title="maou297" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou297.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Mur: Remember, Midou. Remember our shared sins. It is a crime that no amount of apologies will wash away. However, we pressed on for the sake of a single goal – to protect the world from the horrors of the Ginseigou. To prevent any more tragedies from happening! You took all those lives for that reason.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou… if you truly wish for the apocalypse, all the people whose lives we took will have died in vain! You cannot possibly want that!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…<br>
Cha: Oh, that’s right. But you see, his love for Hikaru is even stronger.</p>
<p>Mur: Chachamaru?!</p>
<p>Cha: Don’t take me too lightly. I can’t dispel your influence, but I can do this much, at least.</p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki. Don’t lose sight of what’s important. If you truly care for Hikaru, then protect her at all costs! Who cares if the world will be sacrificed in the process?! So one is allowed to make sacrifices for the sake of the world,&nbsp;but sacrificing the world itself for your own sake is out of the question?!&nbsp;Cut the bullshit!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou298.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1761" title="maou298" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou298.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Cha: It’s merely a matter of being powerful enough to sacrifice others. The reason so many people are sacrificed in the world is due to its sheer might. But if we exceed the entire universe in power, *our* wish is the one that shall be granted!</p>
<p>Cha: This isn’t a question of right or wrong. It’s survival of the fittest. So Kageaki – don’t you give up! Hikaru, you and me – we are connected by one thing. We turn against the entire world in order to fulfill our long-cherished desire!</p>
<p>Mur: Midou. I’m not going to force anything on you. This is your choice.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p>Mur: Do you remember Inagi Tadayasu? I met him the other day. And this is what he told me – “don’t let Nitta Yuuhi’s death be in vain.”</p>
<p>Kag: ……..</p>
<p>Mur: This is all I had to tell you. The rest is up to you. Make your choice, Midou.</p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki!</p>
<p>Mur: Here is my final question to you: are you willing to cast everything aside for the sake of your love towards Hikaru?</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. The game gives us a choice here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou299.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1760" title="maou299" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou299.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>The one on the left says ” No, I can’t” while the right button reads “Yes, I can”.</p>
<p>The correct choice for continuing the route is “No, I can’t”. However, we’ll choose “yes” for now, because it leads to Chachamaru’s special ending. You know what, let’s call it her “route”, however short it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Chachamaru's route]</p>
<p>Kag: Yes, I can. Quite easily. If it helps me save Hikaru, I will do it.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou…!</p>
<p>Kag: You told me there were other things in this world that I treasured. You were probably right about that. However, I can cast it all aside. That includes you as well, Muramasa! Begone from my mind!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1759" title="maou300" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou300.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>The Tsurugi in front of me collapses. She is nothing to me now. After throwing one final glance in her direction, I turned my back on her.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki…!</p>
<p>Kag: Why are you hugging me.</p>
<p>Cha: Because I love you! I knew you would choose me!</p>
<p>Kag: I didn’t choose *you*.</p>
<p>Cha: That’s fine by me! *giggles*</p>
<p>Kag: Let’s go.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Kag: Actually, wait. What should we do about that?</p>
<p><em>I pointed at the now motionless Tsurugi.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Shall we destroy her?</p>
<p>Cha: Doesn’t really matter anymore. She has no influence on you any longer. This time for real.</p>
<p>They go back to the castle.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou301.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1758" title="maou301" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou301.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kag: All that’s left for us is to wait for the bomb to be dropped, right?</p>
<p>Cha: That’s right.</p>
<p>Then they notice Doushin up in th skies, about to confront Hikaru. They also take notice of Raichou, and decide to defeat him first.</p>
<p>I recorded the upcoming scene and added English subs to the video, you can watch it below:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="584" height="359" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/5tLa8nFTzvQ.html" frameborder="0"></iframe></span>
<p>Raichou: Things aren’t looking good. Lord Doushin’s strength is proving not to be sufficient…I shall have to take to the skies personally!</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Over my dead body. Think I’m gonna let you do as you please?</p>
<p>Rai: Chachamaru?! Where have you been hiding all this time?</p>
<p>Cha: No time for chitchat. The end times are upon us.</p>
<p>Cha :So let’s skip all that and get right down to business.</p>
<p>Rai: Go on, say what you want.</p>
<p>Cha: Raichou… I’ve come to take your life.</p>
<p>Rai: I see. So… you were behing everything all along.</p>
<p>Cha: Hahaha, so the secret’s finally out! All this time, you’ve done nothing but dance to my tune!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou303.jpg"><img title="maou303" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou303.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: And yet I clearly recall you doing nothing but losing your cool in unexpected situations…</p>
<p>Well, excuse *me* for not handling things as smoothly as the genius mastermind from some hour-and-a-half movie!</p>
<p>Kag: Such a disapppointment you are.</p>
<p>Cha: Sowwy, I’ll try harder next time…</p>
<p>Rai: Hmpf. You expect to challenge me with only the two of you? You are so desperate it’s almost adorable.</p>
<p>Cha: I don’t suppose you’re gonna go easy on us, right?</p>
<p>Rai: Don’t be ridiculous. I’m planning to do quite the opposite, in fact. I’ll carve you to pieces! Hizamaru!</p>
<p>Raichou dons his armor.</p>
<p>Rai: It appears you have some confidence in your swordsmanship, Minato. However, you would do well not to group me together with that weakling you fought the other day. You are welcome to try and wound my steel… if you can!</p>
<p>Kag: I believe I will have to take you up on that offer, Your Excellency.</p>
<p>Cha: Yup. But you know, Kageaki, you would be better off fighting him in full armor.</p>
<p>Kag: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Cha: The most fitting weapon for you is not that sword you’re holding onto. No, it lies elsewhere – here, with me. You know what I mean, don’t you? I’m sure you do. Our fates are already connected, after all. The only weapon you need, Kageaki… is right here…!</p>
<p>Rai: Your words are nonsense to my ears… however, if you have nothing better to do than whisper amongst each other, I’ll have to go ahead and crush the both of you right here, right now!</p>
<p>Cha: Say it, Kageaki!</p>
<p>Cha: Call my name!</p>
<p><em>A single phrase emerges from the depths of my soul. I part my lips and begin to recite its words.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Kotetsu.</p>
<p>Rai: W-what in the…?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou304.jpg"><img title="maou304" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou304.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a><br>
Kag:<em> Flesh for the lion; bones for the hound; a brilliant soul for the dragon. Crimson blood to quench the nocturnal thirst of the tiger.</em></p>
<p>Rai: Chachamaru… what in the world are you?</p>
<p>Cha: Well then – the time to cross blades has come! My very first battle! Let us go, Kageaki… no, Midou!</p>
<p>[background music during the scene: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8cEueHSZr4">Uzuki</a> by VERTUEUX]</p>

<p>Kag: Yeah.</p>
<p>Cha: Our foe is none other than the commander of the Rokuhara forces, Imagawa Raichou! He’s no pushover, but with the two of us, we can definitely emerge victorious!</p>
<p>Cha: Midou! To battle!</p>
<p>Kag: Aye!</p>
<p><em>With steel in hand, he rushes towards the golden giant; his first opponent as “Kotetsu”. </em></p>
<p><em>And so, Minato Kageaki plunges into the battle that shall be his last.</em></p>
<p>[Credits roll]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Epilogue]</p>
<p>Cha: Gosh, that was quite a tough battle…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Indeed…</p>
<p><em>Chachmaru and myself were sitting atop a mountain of debris – until recently, this ruin used to be Fudaraku Castle. </em></p>
<p><em>The land before us was robed in the color of dusk. The fabric of the sky was being lit up by a multitude of silver stars flickering about its canvas like fireflies. However, the most brilliant of them all was nowhere to be found. The bomb had been dropped, and Hikaru disappeared along with it. I know not what became of her.</em></p>
<p>Cha: She’ll be back. She’ll become a god and return to us, I’m sure of it. After all, you’re here, waiting for her.</p>
<p><em>I made no answer. We kept sitting there in utter stillness, merely waiting for time to pass.</em></p>
<p><em>Our surroundings were enveloped by a deep silence, almost as if the land itself was welcoming the world’s final days. All that remained was the ever-silent dance of light and darkness.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Um… you know, there’s still one thing I haven’t revealed to you.</p>
<p>Kag: Out with it.</p>
<p>Cha: It was love at first sight. I fell for you the very first time I heard your voice.</p>
<p>Kag: I see.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou307.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1752" title="maou307" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou307.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>The world is nearing its end.</em></p>
<p><em>And God will soon descend upon this earth, now a silent sea governed by the hands of Time alone.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Chachamaru's route END]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Back to Muramasa’s route:</p>
<p>Okay, let’s go back to that choice now and select the other option.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Here is my final question to you: are you willing to cast everything aside for the sake of your love towards Hikaru?</p>
<p><em>“Yes, I can.” My soul would truly be at peace if I uttered those words.</em></p>
<p><em>Living for Hikaru’s sake alone. Caring for her. Protecting her. Saving her.</em></p>
<p><em>My soul would be at peace obeying those thoughts alone, blindly following that single idea.</em></p>
<p><em>I remember it all – the sins committed by these two hands. The scent of blood. The final breaths of those I murdered. The exact moment when that last shred of light slips away from their eyes. I recall all those deaths.</em></p>
<p><em>Why did I kill all those people?</em></p>
<p><em>The meaning behind their deaths is known only to me. I murdered them to prevent an even greater tragedy.</em></p>
<p><em>If I let the Ginseigou roam free in her current state… if I allow such a thing, then what meaning is there to their sacrifices?</em></p>
<p><em>I would end up denying the very fact that their deaths had a meaning.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou308.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1751" title="maou308" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou308.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kag: I… I can’t do that.</p>
<p><em>Deciding what should be forgiven and what shouldn’t be. What can be labeled as a sin and what cannot. I would elevate myself above all that.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot bring myself to do such a thing – w</em><em>eighing the worth of lives, deciding that one is more important than another.</em></p>
<p><em>At the very least, I owe it to them to admit that they died for the sake of preventing an even greater disaster. Knowing that it is the height of arrogance, it is nonetheless &nbsp;my duty as the one responsible for their deaths to at least acknowledge that fact.</em></p>
<p><em>I must never forget them.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to hold onto their memories.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon returning to the corporeal world, the first sensation that assaulted me was a severe sense of discord.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/maou309.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" title="maou309" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou309.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Ah… ahhh!</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou! Please, calm yourself. Take it nice and slow, one step at a time.</p>
<p><em>Muramasa approached and propped me up with her arms. Her hands were cold – a fact I was thankful for. If they were warm, I might have collapsed and let myself be embraced by sleep right here. Instead, the coldness of her touch gave me the strength to stand on my own two feet.</em></p>
<p><em>Her touch was the coldness of steel, the temperature symbolizing her power.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Are you alright?</p>
<p>Kag: Y-yes. I can stand on my own now.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa.</p>
<p>Mur: Yes?</p>
<p>Kag: I’m finally back, aren’t I?</p>
<p>Mur: Yes… you are, Midou…</p>
<p><em>I stood firmly upon the ground – as Minato Kageaki. The sensation that accumulated within me was hardly refreshing, nor did it fill me with strength. Rather, it was the feeling of being grounded in reality – in certainty.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Thank you, Muramasa. You ended up saving me once again.</p>
<p>Mur: Did I really save you, though? I might have just added to your pain…</p>
<p>Kag: That might be true. Until a few minutes ago, my heart was dangerously at ease. Now… it’s different. It weighs heavy in my chest once again.</p>
<p>Mur: I knew that would happen. But… I’m a Tsurugi, my heart made of steel. So I did it regardless.</p>
<p>Kag: I am truly grateful to you.</p>
<p><img title="maou310" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 6 (includes Chachamaru’s ending) _ gareblogs_files/maou310.jpg" width="584" height="326"></p>
<p>Mur: Midou…?</p>
<p>Kag: It is all thanks to that steel heart of yours that I can stand here once again as the real me, truly in control of myself.</p>
<p>Mur: W-what is that supposed to mean…</p>

<p>Background music during the scene: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193644/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpQWMOjYoaA">Muramasa (Shield)</a></p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa…</p>
<p>Mur: I’m so sorry! I didn’t want to force you to choose… I just wanted you to come back to me…! I didn’t want to be separated from you anymore!</p>
<p>Mur: You could’ve blamed me all you wanted – I know I would’ve deserved every single word of it. After all, I brought you back knowing that it would cause you pain!</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Mur: Please, forgive me…!</p>
<p>She continues sobbing.</p>
<p>Kageaki: There is no need to apologize. You did the right thing. Without a doubt. I truly am grateful to you, from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Mur: Please, not another word! I don’t want to hear it! &nbsp;*sob*</p>
<p><em>All I could do was wait and support her in silence – she who suddenly began shedding tears due to an immense sense of guilt and remorse that I did not fully comprehend myself. </em></p>
<p><em>So there I stood, waiting patiently for the storm that shook the innermost depths of her heart to finally pass on.</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>(I’ll say one thing here: Muramasa is such a fantastic character.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Even though it was rather short, I still liked Chachamaru’s ending. But still, Chachamaru is as misterious as ever, what the hell she really is a Tsurugi, a Human or something else. I hope this is adressed in the future.</p>
<p>This part was really great, it had plenty of action, with a little plot twists. But my favorite part was still after the choice that you chose Muramasa, she really one of the best character from vn that I know of.</p>
<p>Thanks for this summary as always, garejei.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Muramasa 2 and 3 can transform into human form, so it’s not too unbelievable that Chachamaru could do the same. But yeah, I’m still not entirely sure how she fits into the story or if she has a bigger, more elaborate role in the plot compared to what we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>I gotta agree about Muramasa. Her scenes in this chapter and the previous one were some of the most moving bits in the game so far, at least in the original Japanese. I don’t know how well it comes across in English.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>In Part 3 it was briefly mentioned by Moriuji that Chachamaru is of Emishi blood (he says it right before being killed by her in the woods). I merely summed up the scene in my own words, but it seems like that was a mistake. I went back and added direct translations of the dialogue now. (thankfully I still had an older savegame before that scene)</p>
<p>Kageaki being a badass who can kill a Tsurugi with one blow will be essential, I think. I’m not sure how, but I have that feeling. He already did it at Enoshima against Sorimachi, and the mysterious image of a helmet being sliced in half keeps coming back. I’m sure it will be explained sooner or later.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Now that you’ve added that about Chachamaru, my last concern about her is why she can hear “God”. But this will prbably be adressed in the nearby future.</p>
<p>That part of the helmet is repetitively shown in the vn, I also hope that it’s meaning is explained, hopefully sooner than later. The past of Kageaki is also a mistery in some parts; he’s adopted so who are his real family, Shishiku tells him that he resembles his brother. There is also that scene about the Chief being banned from the village and Kageaki being present and involved in it.</p>
<p>So many misteries still need to be put into light for it to end.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Kageaki’s real parents went off to fight in some war and died. It was mentioned in Chapter 5 if I’m not mistaken, but it’s been a while since I played that chapter so I don’t remember the details.</p>
<p>If literally translated, “Midou” means shrine/temple, but in this context it’s just the honorific title that Tsurugi use to refer to their masters.</p>

<p>But if his real parents died fighting in a war, they must have been important. I would also love that this issue be adressed in the future.</p>
