<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Tyrant </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Part 4</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This project is a fairly old work of mine, written and translated back in 2012, when I was still just starting out as a fan translator — as such, it’s not exactly the highest quality work I’ve ever put out, to say the least. I would’ve deleted it long ago, but since people still seem to be interested in it, I decided to keep it, but felt the need to give this quick warning beforehand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-1471"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-3/">Back to Muramasa’s route, Part 3</a></p>
<p>The next day, Kageaki is out in the garden training/meditating, accompanied by Muramasa. Basically, he realizes that the only way to defeat Hikaru is to achieve perfection by completely emptying his mind and discarding all worldly thoughts. He could then enter then required mental state to match the Ginseigou in combat. Mastering this technique is insanely difficult, though, so Kageaki can’t just do it on a whim. He tries catching a bird before it flies away but fails, and the scene ends.</p>
<p>We then cut to Chachamaru being visited in her office by Yusa Doushin. He wants Chachamaru to return to Fudaraku right away, but she declines. We also find out that this is a few days after he raped Sakurako. (which Kageaki didn’t witness this time, since in this route he obviously wasn’t there. If you want to what happened just read Ichijou’s route, if you haven’t already. But yeah, regardless of whether or not Kageaki was there to see it, it happened all the same.)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou103.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1566" title="maou103" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou103.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>He then decides to leave, but before going, makes a comment about Chachamaru and how her eyes reflect a soul lost in deep despair. After Dosuhin leaves, Chachamaru mutters to herself that it’s not despair, but exhaustion.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou104.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1565" title="maou104" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou104.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>We’re then back with Kageaki and Muramasa in the garden. Kageaki is continuing his practice. This time he closes his eyes and attempts to sense when a leaf is about to fall from a nearby tree so he could catch it, but he fails once again, and grabs… the body of Doushin, who’s approached him while his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>Kageaki: *grab*</p>
<p>Doushin: …..</p>
<p>Kageaki: *in his usual emotionless tone* Oh dear.</p>
<p>Doushin: You’re not very good at showing emotions, are you? May I ask what you were doing just now?</p>
<p>Kageaki hesitates for a few seconds but decides to tell him anyway.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I was in the middle of mental training.</p>
<p>Doushin: I see, I see. For what purpose?</p>
<p>Kageaki:&nbsp; To defeat an immensely powerful enemy. However, I have not been able to succeed in attaining the proper mental state.</p>
<p>Kageaki: If it is not a huge problem, would you mind offering some advice? How could an average man like me possibly achieve such perfection?</p>
<p>Doushin lets out his usual guffaw as a response.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou105.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564" title="maou105" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou105.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: H-hey! How dare you laugh at someone else’s troubles!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa. Calm down.</p>
<p>Doushin: No, no, her anger is understandable. I apologize, young man. However, tell me this – what exactly is this mental state you spoke of?</p>
<p>Kageaki: It is a state where the person can free himself from all worldy attachments. He longs for nothing, desires nothing, and thus empties his mind from all obstructive thoughts to become one with the universe.</p>
<p>Doushin: You told me earlier that you desire this in order to defeat a powerful enemy, did you not? However… isn’t that a worldly attachment in itself? As long as you desire victory, you will never be able to rid your thoughts of such attachments. A man who has reached the mental state you speak of would go into battle not caring about its outcome. In other words, training like you are, all in order to overcome a powerful enemy, is completely and utterly meaningless.</p>
<p>Another guffaw follows.</p>
<p>Muramasa: He’s still pissing me off, though. Please let me punch him at least once.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Soothe your anger, Muramasa. Had he not offered his advice, who knows how long I would have continued this pointless training. You have told me something very important, wise monk. I express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Doushin: Hahaha. Well then, hear me out, young man. What you should focus on isn’t an empty mind, but an empty self. The complete renunciation of yourself. What you should discard is not the outer world, but your very own inner world.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou106.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" title="maou106" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou106.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Wouldn’t such a state be equally meaningless for me…?</p>
<p><em>The desire to defeat Hikaru stems from my very soul. Should I extinguish my own self, that desire would disappear along with it.</em></p>
<p>Doushin: Oh, you mean that the desire to defeat your enemy could be considered your own selfish desire? Is that really that case, though…?</p>
<p>Muramasa: Well… I will not go into details, but let’s just say that not only us, but the whole world would benefit from her demise. Don’t get me wrong, though. We are no heroes, and would never label our actions as “justice” or any other nonsense.</p>
<p>Doushin: Oh, but for our current discussion, that very “nonsense” is quite essential. Young man, the fact that you view your fight against this enemy as being rooted in your own self-interests is a misunderstanding on your part. To be in the state of “empty self” means not having any such interests to begin with. There exists nothing but the laws of this world. The basic desire for your enemy to be defeated is the will of the universe itself. Even if your own personal desire for victory should disappear along with your own self, the universe will find a way to force your body into motion and make sure that your enemy falls.</p>
<p>Doushin: You would no doubt end up slaying people like me! Oh dear, I am digging my own grave by giving you advice here! Ohohoho!</p>
<p>Kageaki is quite speechless and the scene ends with Doushin chuckling to himself while leaving the garden.</p>
<p>We cut to later that day at the dining table.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/murcha.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1567" title="murcha" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/murcha.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: There seemed to be a bit of a commotion earlier today.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Oh, that? I merely had an… undesirable guest of sorts. I drove him away quickly enough.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Could it have been that monk we met earlier?</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, so you met him?</p>
<p>Mur: Hmpf. We did. He did nothing but rudely laugh in our faces, though. So, that… “thing” was one of your friends, I take it?</p>
<p>Cha: Friends? If someone suggested that I’d think they wanted to provoke me to a fight. Pfft.</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, but the two of you would make a fine pair! A duo of annoying troublemakers.</p>
<p>Cha: Seems like you really do wanna provoke me to a fight, am I correct?!</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Cha: *to Kageaki* What’s wrong? Not happy with the food?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Ah, forgive me. No, the meal is fine.</p>
<p>Mur: Can I have seconds?</p>
<p>Cha: Oh, o-okay. Here you go.</p>
<p>Mur: Thanks. ^_^</p>
<p>Cha: ………….</p>
<p>Cha: WAIT A GODDAMN SECOND. Why am I catering to your every need like this?!</p>
<p>Mur: Hmpf, fine. I won’t ask you again, then. *turns to Kageaki* Midou, seconds?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes, please.</p>
<p>Mur: Here you go. ^_^</p>
<p>Mur: *giggles*</p>
<p>Kageaki: Something wrong?</p>
<p>Mur: Ah, nothing. I was just enjoying the atmosphere~</p>
<p>Cha: URGE TO KILL RISING.</p>
<p>Mur: What’s up with you? You get angry when someone asks you for seconds, and now you’re mad because we aren’t doing it. You’re a weird one.</p>
<p>Cha: *sob* *sob*</p>
<p>Cha: Wait a sec, why are you even eating?! Aren’t you a Tsurugi?!</p>
<p><em>That’s right. I myself have failed to notice this up until now.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Aw, c’mon. What’s so wrong with it? At least Let me enjoy the fact that I managed to transform back into human. In fact, I can actually gain a certain amount of energy by eating food.</p>
<p>Cha: A certain amount? More specifically…?</p>
<p>Mur: Hmm. I could probably get the amount of energy a normal person gains from one meal by consuming an entire sack of rice.</p>
<p>Cha: YOU…! YOU GO AND APOLOGIZE. APOLOGIZE TO ALL THE HARDWORKING FARMERS OUT ON THE FIELDS. RIGHT NOW. DO THAT AND NEVER EAT ANOTHER BITE EVER AGAIN.</p>
<p>Some more hijinks ensue, but the group quickly changes the subject to what Doushin told Kageaki earlier.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’ve been thinking about what he told me…</p>
<p>Mur: Ah, you mean that monk from earlier…?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes. I do believe he gave me some very important advice.</p>
<p>Cha: Ugh, I’m being left in the dark… T_T</p>
<p>Mur: Sorry about that. Hmm, I see… if you think it was important, Midou, then-</p>
<p>Cha: Hey, don’t just apologize and then ignore me! I demand an explanation!</p>
<p>Mur: It doesn’t concern you.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou107.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562" title="maou107" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou107.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Cha: I’m the head of this household, I forbid any and all secrecy under my roof!</p>
<p>Cha: Well, in any case. *to Kageaki* What happened?</p>
<p>Kageaki considers whether or not telling her about it is a good idea, considering that she’s a supporter of the Ginseigou, but he concludes that hearing an outsider’s opinion might end up helping him, so he tells her anyway.</p>
<p>Cha: In other words, you’re a hero. Someone who fights for the sake of the world, and not for himself.</p>
<p>Kageaki objects, but Chachamaru replies yet again:</p>
<p>Cha: But, the truth is, you really didn’t want to do it, right? Killing all those innocents, opposing your very own sister…</p>
<p>Kageaki: No, about that-</p>
<p>Flashback to Sorimachi’s words in Chapter 4.</p>
<p><em>“And yet you keep killing! That kid, those sisters, each and every one of them! Saying that you don’t want to do it, yet you murdered them all the same!”</em></p>
<p>Cha: You didn’t want to… but you did it anyway. Knowing that it was for the greater good, and that countless others would die if you didn’t do it.</p>
<p>Kag: You’re wrong…</p>
<p><em>There was a certain amount of truth to her words. And yet, she was still wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot allow myself to be called a hero. Ever.</em></p>
<p>Cha: You’re thinking too much about this, Kageaki. You won’t ever be able to defeat Hikaru like that.</p>
<p><em>Her voice was gentle, her tone showing sympathy.</em></p>
<p><em>She was the devil whispering into my ear.</em></p>
<p>Cha: You’ve fought so many battles, saved so many people. If you aren’t worthy of being called a hero, I don’t know who is. And yet… you cannot possibly overcome Hikaru. I wonder why that is…?</p>
<p>Cha: The hero is destined to topple the tyrant. If the universe wills it, it shall happen, without fail.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou108.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1561" title="maou108" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou108.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Cha: And yet… you could never defeat her. The reason for that is simple – you aren’t a full-fledged hero just yet.</p>
<p>Kag: ………</p>
<p>Cha: You don’t want to fight her. You never did. And you simply cannot bring yourself to kill her. That’s why you haven’t been able to defeat her. How could you possibly achieve that if you’re not fully resolved to kill your enemy? See, those are the shackles you should discard. In other words, you…</p>
<p>Kag: …discard the self.</p>
<p>Cha: Yes. Extinguish your own self. Discard your personal feelings. Consider her as nothing more than a wicked tyrant, an enemy of the entire world. And thus, the path towards becoming a true hero shall open.</p>
<p>Kag: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p>Cha: ………?</p>
<p>Kag: Aren’t you an ally of the Ginseigou? So why are you telling me something like this?</p>
<p>Cha: Well… I do love her to bits, but an ally? Nah, not really. You see, those who have allies have enemies as well. And you know very well how Muramasa brings death upon both friend and foe. If I truly was an ally of her, I would’ve died ages ago! No, she actually murders others without even a shred of animosity towards them.</p>
<p>Cha: Actually, if there’s anyone who would truly be my ally, it’s you.</p>
<p>Muramasa: You do know that the law of Muramasa applies to us too, right? Death upon both friend and foe.</p>
<p>Cha: I don’t care. I would die for Kageaki if that is what he wanted. If it meant that he’d become a true hero and opposed the tyrant…</p>
<p>Kag: ………..</p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki. Let’s do this together. You and me.</p>
<p><em>She leaned in and gently whispered into my ears.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Let us kill Hikaru.</p>
<p>End of scene, and we cut to Muramasa, alone and deep in thought on the veranda.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou109.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1560" title="maou109" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou109.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a><br>
<em>I am alone, while Kageaki is back in the garden, no doubt considering all the things he’s just been told. As far as I’m concerned, both that disgusting priest and that girl are trying to lead him astray. It makes me mad. And yet, I can’t possibly tell him about my worries. I would overstep by boundaries as a Tsurugi. In the end, making decisions is up to him, as the master. As a Tsurugi I am not allowed to supply him with more than my opinion. Otherwise, it would seem like I am not fully trusting my master. It would mean that I betrayed the earnest trust he had placed in me. I couldn’t bear the thought of that.</em></p>
<p><em>Even I need some time to be alone. At times like this, all the doubts and anxieties within my heart always came rushing back to the forefront of my mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Ever since that day, Kageaki had come to occupy more and more of my thoughts.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1559" title="maou110" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou110.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou… that day, you told me that I was the only one meant for you.</p>
<p><em>My thoughts wandered back to the events of that afternoon, the passion of that moment.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: Could this feeling be… a hindrance…?</p>
<p><em>The fact that I view him as more than my master – as another person. Could this feeling end up being an obstacle to achieving the perfect union between master and Tsurugi – the union of soul and steel truly becoming one?</em></p>
<p><em>I have slumbered in solitude for 500 years, covered in darkness. Two years ago, I was finally released, but my feelings of loneliness remained unchanged – until that afternoon. That day, for the first time in two years, a true master-Tsurugi relationship came to be born between the two of us. My feelings of loneliness became a thing of the past.</em></p>
<p><em>When I was originally sealed away, my wish was to remain dormant for all eternity. I knew very well what tragedies it might cause should I be allowed to roam free. However, I found happiness in my present freedom. I firmly took hold of the helping hand that Kageaki so kindly extended towards me, determined to never let go of it.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>Can such feelings be considered a hindrance?</em></p>
<p><em>The Ginseigou – Nisei Muramasa and her master – did not appear to have a mutual concern for each other at all. Is my relationship with Kageaki supposed to end up like that as well…?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou111.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1558" title="maou111" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou111.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><br>
<em>I let out yet another sigh. It seems to become a habit every time I’m alone.</em></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>So we cut to the garden with Kageaki. He’s holding a sword he got from Chachamaru, determined to slay Hikaru with it.</p>
<p><em>I’ll have to kill the Ginseigou- no, Hikaru. I have to think of her like that.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll kill her.</em></p>
<p><em>My very own sister. Subaru’s daughter.</em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, she steps into the garden and in front of Kageaki. She notices that he’s holding a sword.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou112.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1557" title="maou112" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou112.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><br>
Hikaru: I suppose that’s for me.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You can tell…?</p>
<p><em>She was standing right in front of me. The blade in my hand was real – genuine steel capable of cutting flesh and bone. And yet, my heart was the very thing that forced me to stay my mind. </em></p>
<p><em>Lingering feelings for her.</em></p>
<p><em>Extinguish those feelings.</em></p>
<p><em>Feel her breath in the very air that surrounds you, feel her heartbeat, the workings of her mind, her life and death – control her fate, bend it to your will.</em></p>
<p><em>Catching the wind itself would be a simpler task.</em></p>
<p><em>Nonetheless, I will do it. I can.</em></p>
<p><em>Therein lies the very core of this principle. See what cannot possibly seen by the naked eye.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1556" title="maou113" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou113.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>Like so. In a world such as this, viewed from this angle, her figure becomes more and more distant.</em></p>
<p><em>She disappeared.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it due to my inexperience in being able to sense her…?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou114.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1555" title="maou114" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou114.jpg" width="584" height="322"></a><br>
<em>I could only feel a faint presence.</em></p>
<p>Kag: Hikaru… are you *really* there?</p>
<p><em>A few moments later, I could do nothing but gaze up at the sky, completely robbed of all of my energy. However, although I was about to fall, my back did not hit the floor – I was being held by someone.</em></p>
<p><em>That someone was Hikaru.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: You wanted to catch up to me that badly…? You are so adorable. Your pure, honest tenacity was truly a lovely sight to behold. What I did at Hachimangu Shrine the other day was all thanks to that.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You… you could see through me?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Yes. Quite easily. To put it simply, you were struggling to discard all of your worldly thoughts to be able to perceive me more vividly.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou115.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1554" title="maou115" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou115.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: *giggling* Yes, I can tell. I could rather easily read the innermost workings of your soul.</p>
<p>Kageaki: But, I myself wasn’t able to do it…</p>
<p>Hikaru: Don’t be in such a hurry.</p>
<p><em>She reached out towards my cheeks and ever so gently wiped most of the dirt from it.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: I’m right here. I’m not going to leave you behind. I’ll be waiting for you.</p>
<p><em>I was being gently comforted by the very person I was fated to kill. Rather than being ashamed of myself, hearing her kind words left me with a feeling of utter confusion and turmoil.</em></p>
<p><em>What is this feeling?</em></p>
<p><em>I… I have to kill her.</em></p>
<p><em>I lifted my hand and slowly reached for her throat.</em></p>
<p><em>Right here, right now.</em></p>
<p><em>What would happen if I allowed her to go free now? She would no doubt become the Ginseigou once again and wreak havoc across the land. She would be the cause of countless more deaths.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, I cannot possibly delay any longer. I’ll have to put an end to this right now.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Kageaki. I can tell that you’re suffering. I can taste the very sweetness of your pain. And yet… I’ll admit that seeing you like this is hard on me as well.</p>
<p><em>Once again she lifted her fingers – the very same hand that caused the deaths of thousands and spilled the blood of numerous innocents – and began caressing my tired cheeks.</em></p>
<p><em>I couldn’t tell anymore whether her touch was cold or warm. I simply did not wish to know.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Very well. Kageaki, I will rid you of all your pain.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou117.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1552" title="maou117" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou117.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a><br>
Her silver Tsurugi appears and showers her in a bright light.</p>
<p><em>An egg?!</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: An egg is the crystallization of the waves I emit. When used like this, it should have an effect even on you.</p>
<p>Kageaki has a flashback of all those people driven mad by its influence.</p>
<p><em>Am I going to become like them…?</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: This will completely strip your soul of everything except desire. The only person you’ll be able to think of will be me, and only me.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Stop it!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Calm yourself. It won’t last forever. Once this world, the very root of all your suffering and agony, has come to and end, you will turn back to your former self. So let your heart slumber in quiet idleness until that time comes.</p>
<p><em>I was frantically grasping for the sword that had fallen from my hands. It was futile – she had me firmly in her grip. There was no escape.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa suddenly shows up and interrupts them.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou120.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1549" title="maou120" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou120.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a>Hikaru: Kageaki’s Muramasa, eh? Hmpf. The one who can guide Kageaki towards the right path is me. I have no more use for you. Begone from this world!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Stop it, Hikaru! I will never forgive you if you harm Muramasa!</p>
<p><em>Hikaru grew paler. She was truly hurt by those words. She then threw her gaze once again in Muramasa’s direction, and looked&nbsp;</em><em>at her with a bitterness I recalled seeing once before…</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou119.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1550" title="maou119" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou119.jpg" width="584" height="322"></a><br>
Kageaki: (I have to stop them…!)</p>
<p><em>I was frozen in place, unable to move. Has she already done something to me earlier…?</em></p>
<p><em>The helping hand I was craving for was extended from a truly unexpected direction – the silver Tsurugi behind her.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa 2: *to Hikaru* Midou, are you really sure you want to do this?</p>
<p>Hikaru: And what exactly do you mean by that…?</p>
<p>Muramasa 2: You can’t tell? Ah, of course you can’t. After all, this isn’t something you’ve experienced before.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Don’t make me play a guessing game, Muramasa! Tell me already!</p>
<p>Muramasa 2: Very well. Midou, what you are feeling towards her right now is animosity. You are filled with&nbsp; hatred towards her as an enemy.</p>
<p>Hikaru: ………!!</p>
<p><em>Indeed. She, too, was bound by the law of Muramasa. Death upon friend and foe.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa 2: Should you slay her right now, someone else will have to die as well. And Midou… you know better than anyone who that other person would be.</p>
<p>Hikaru: You’re right…</p>
<p><em>She looked up at the boundless sky, as if begging for forgiveness from something or someone up in the clouds. Forgiveness that, in the end, she did not receive. Filled with nothing but regret, she clenched her fists and left, accompanied by the silver Tsurugi.</em></p>
<p><em>Only the two of us remained in the garden.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1548" title="maou121" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou121.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou. Are you alright? Did she do anything to you?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m fine. And it’s all thanks to you.</p>
<p>Muramasa: *blushing* Don’t mention it.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m glad you’re unhurt.</p>
<p>Muramasa: And we have Mother to thank for that.</p>
<p>We then very briefly cut to Hikaru and Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Hey there~</p>
<p>Hikaru: Falling Down Ladybug* Abridged Version!!</p>

Kapow!</p>
<p>*the signature attack she usually uses in her Ginseigou form.</p>
<p>Cha: Ow! What was that for?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: That was for clearly ignoring a lady’s distress even though you’ve heard every single word of our conversation!</p>
<p>Cha: Well, yeah. More or less.</p>
<p>Hikaru: That fool of a brother. To think he would let himself be charmed by that woman…</p>
<p>So anyway, Hikaru is irritated by Muramasa and Kageaki but in the end, she concludes that her wish will be granted if she only keeps spreading violence across the land so it’s fine.</p>
<p>Cha: So, um… can I have that?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Oh, you mean this egg? You want it?</p>
<p>(it’s the egg she made for Kageaki but ended up never using)</p>
<p>Cha: Yup. There might come a time when I’ll need it.</p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>Cut to nighttime.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/night.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1569" title="night" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/night.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: It has been quite a busy day.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Indeed. A lot happened.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Shouldn’t we call it a day? You know, before a certain weirdo shows her face around us again.</p>
<p>So they enter their bedroom.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Muramasa: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><em>Something was out of place. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. After all, the room was as we left it. It had been cleaned, natuarlly, but that was to be expected. There wasn’t supposed to be anything odd about it.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: There’s a faint scent… of flowers.</p>
<p>Muramasa: You mean that one over there, in thee vase?</p>
<p>Kageaki: That too.</p>
<p>Muramasa: “too”…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: There’s one more. One that reinds me of the days I spent in the military.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dude dressed in all black jumps out from his hiding spot. We already know from Ichijou’s route that he’s Sakurako’s brother, but this route’s Kageaki doesn’t know that yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou123.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1546" title="maou123" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou123.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: I take it you’re not a dweller of this mansion.</p>
<p>Man: ………</p>
<p>Muramasa: Shouldn’t that be obvious? I mean, considering the situation.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I wonder…</p>
<p>Mur: Huh?</p>
<p>Kageaki: There’s always the possibility that he is on the cleaning staff and was simply doing his job very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Mur: Are you kidding me? Why would he do the cleaning dressed like that?</p>
<p>Kageaki: To protect himself from dust?</p>
<p>Mur: Yeah, right!</p>
<p>Man: How dare you make fun of me!</p>
<p>Mur: See? He’s angry. Midou, did you honestly think he was the cleaning man?</p>
<p>Kag: Don’t be ridiculous. He’s obviously a suspicious character of some sort. This isn’t the time or the place to be joking around, Muramasa.</p>
<p>Mur: *see image below*</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/pissed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1568" title="pissed" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/pissed.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a><br>
Kageaki then explains that they aren’t working for the Rokuhara, so his hostility towards them is meaningless. The man then declares that his reason for being here is actually theft. In the end, Kageaki decides to let him go. He even shows him the way out.</p>
<p>Kageaki: It might be nighttime, but you should be careful nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou124.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1545" title="maou124" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou124.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><br>
Man: Thank you. One more thing. May I hear your names one more time?</p>
<p>Kag: Minato Kageaki. She’s Muramasa.</p>
<p>Kuronose: Minato Kageaki. I will never forget what you did for me tonight. Well then. Farewell.</p>
<p>And he goes off.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Today sure ended up being rather busy.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Indeed.</p>
<p>Muramasa: I told you we should’ve gone to bed earlier!</p>
<p>They go back to their rooms and Kageaki falls asleep within minutes. We then cut to this:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1544" title="maou125" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou125.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a>Kag: What… is this place?</p>
<p>Purple suit guy: You’re dreaming.</p>
<p>Kag: And who might you be…?</p>
<p>Purple: I am the spirit of your Tsurugi, Muramasa.</p>
<p>Kag: LIKE HELL YOU ARE.</p>
<p>The dream comes crumbling down and we cut to… Hikaru? And Chachamaru as well.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hmm. Seems like I made quite a few mistakes there…</p>
<p>Cha: Hikaru… whatcha doing out there on the roof?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah, Chachamaru. Nothing in particular. I was merely trying to find out what sort of woman Kageaki likes. I was trying to manipulate his dreams in a way so that his Muramasa couldn’t detect it… but it’s not as easy as I thought. If only that woman wasn’t in my way… Hey, Chachamaru! Since you’re here, come and help me out.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou126.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1543" title="maou126" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou126.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a><br>
Cha: Huh? Me?</p>
<p>And we cut back to yet another dream of Kageaki. (okay, so what the hell is Hikaru doing to the poor guy? This game is getting more and more confusing by the second.)</p>
<p><em>What’s this place?</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, that’s right. I was on my way to school.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou127.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1542" title="maou127" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou127.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: Yeah, that’s it! It’s going really well this time!</p>
<p>Kag: I overslept. I need to hurry up or I’ll be late from school…</p>
<p>???: Oh my oh my oh my! I’m gonna be laaaate!</p>
<p>A young girl dressed in pink almost crashes into Kageaki, but he skillfuly dodges and continues on to school.</p>
<p>Cha: Huh, seems like they managed to avoid each other…</p>
<p>Hikaru: Of course! Kageaki could dodge something like that with his eyes closed! On to the next one!</p>
<p>Back to Kageaki.</p>
<p>Good. I managed to make it in time.</p>
<p>Teacher: *to another girl* You’re late! You’re coming with me!</p>
<p>Girl: Nnnnooo…!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou128.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1541" title="maou128" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou128.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Teacher: Up until now you’ve always been on time! For someone like you whose grades are subpar at best, to have your one redeeming quality taken away – hahaha, you’re never gonna find employment at this rate, ahahaha!!</p>
<p>Girl: T_T</p>
<p>Other boys: The poor thing. Shouldn’t you help her out?</p>
<p>Yet another boy: No way! If that monster of a professor sees me I’m done for!</p>
<p>Kageaki: …….. Well then. I’ll just head over to my classroom.</p>
<p>Cha: Like, nothing happened there. No love, no excitement, no nothing.</p>
<p>Hikaru: That’s it! It’s her fault for being late. I see, I see. It&nbsp; seems like he won’t be able to consider the teacher as a clear bad guy at this rate…</p>
<p>Hikaru: If he had stood up to defend her, she would’ve been off the hook without getting the punishment she very well deserves for being late. No doubt an experience like that would’ve had a negative effect on that girl’s life in the long run… I see. As expected of Kageaki – he sure thought this through very carefully!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou129.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1540" title="maou129" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou129.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Cha: In other words, by abandoning her at that moment, he actually saved her?!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Indeed!</p>
<p>Cha: He’s so dreamy!</p>
<p>Hikaru: INDEED!</p>
<p>Cha: Our initial plans sort of fell apart, though.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Okay then! Let’s try it from a different angle!</p>
<p>Back to Kageaki.</p>
<p>???: Ah. Good morning, Minato.</p>
<p>Kag: Good morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou130.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1539" title="maou130" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou130.jpg" width="584" height="322"></a><br>
Class rep: What are you doing walking around here, anyway? You’re always late and your grades are terrible. You should show a better example to your underclassmen! I really dislike people like you, who expect to simply stumble through life!</p>
<p>Kag: I’m very sorry. I’ll be more careful from now on.</p>
<p>Back to Hikaru and Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Cha: ARRGH, there’s like no chemistry between them! No lovey-dovey drama at all!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Seems like an older girl with a strict personality like that isn’t his type, either. Let’s try the opposite next time…</p>
<p>Back to Kageaki.</p>
<p>Girl: Kageaki~ Good morning~</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou131.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1538" title="maou131" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou131.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><br>
Kag: Good morning.</p>
<p>Girl: It’s gotten pretty cold, don’t you think?</p>
<p>Kag: It’s winter, after all.</p>
<p>Girl: I wonder if it’ll snow?</p>
<p>Kag: Sooner or later, it will.</p>
<p>Girl: I really like snow! It’s pretty, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Kag: It is.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou132.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537" title="maou132" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou132.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou133.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1536" title="maou133" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou133.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><br>
Girl: It looks just like cream! Wait, maybe it really is cream! It might be fragments of a huge cake that God is eating up there in the clouds! Parts of it must be falling down! Kageaki, let’s go outside and try it, it might end up being yummy!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Just what are you talking about…?</p>
<p>Girl: Huh?</p>
<p><em>I stood up and gently placed her hand in mine.</em></p>
<p>[sad music starts playing]</p>
<p>Kageaki: It’s… okay. Everything’s going to be just fine. You don’t need to think of anything.</p>
<p>Girl: ????</p>
<p>Kageaki: It must’ve been so hard. You’ve had it rough, haven’t you? But don’t you worry. This illness is not your fault.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou134.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1535" title="maou134" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou134.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><br>
Girl: Illness…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Let’s go.</p>
<p><em>Before I could break down in tears, I took her hand and was ready to go. First I’ll have to take her to the nurse’s office and discuss her condition…</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: Ugh, and now a different sort of drama has reared its ugly head… okay, so how about this?!</p>
<p>Again, back to Kageaki’s dream.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou135.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1534" title="maou135" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou135.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><br>
Pink-haired girl: H-hey… Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kag: Yes?</p>
<p>Pink: You… um, you don’t have a homemade lunch, do you?</p>
<p>Kag: That’s right. I usually go down to the cafeteria to buy something.</p>
<p>Pink: (Ah… thank goodness…)</p>
<p>Kag: …..??</p>
<p>Pink: Ahem! I-I-if it’s a-alright with you… would you accept this boxed lunch?</p>
<p>Kag: Hm?</p>
<p>Pink: You see, um, it was meant for my clubmates, but they’re absent today, and the food would’ve gone to waste otherwise… and I, um, thought you might like it, so here I am!</p>
<p>Kag: I see. In that case…</p>
<p>Pink: Y-you’ll take it?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Pink: R-right… go on, then. But don’t take this the wrong way! It’s n-not like I made it for you or anything!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou136.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1533" title="maou136" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou136.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><br>
Kag: Of course not.</p>
<p>Pink: I mean it! I really… didn’t… m-make it for you or anything…</p>
<p>She then leaves, and Kageaki opens up the lunchbox. In it, there’s a tiny card, with a simple message written on it.</p>
<p><em>“I love you.”</em></p>
<p><em>I see. I understood it all. Everything finally clicked together. Obviously, this letter was not meant for me. However, I will have to thank her for being able to hand such an important lunchbox to a random guy like me. The box itself was filled with all of my favorites. One could almost get the impression that she did extensive research just to find out what sort of food I liked.</em></p>
<p><em>But of course, this was merely a coincidence, nothing more. I knew that. I was not going to misunderstand the situation. How could I possibly.</em></p>
<p>Back to Hikaru, who’s pissed off that nothing’s working. She tries yet another approach.</p>
<p><em>Today, a transfer student was assigned to our class. She sat down next to me.</em></p>
<p>Transfer student: …………</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou137.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1532" title="maou137" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou137.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: …………</p>
<p>TS: …………</p>
<p>Kag: …………</p>
<p>TS: …………</p>
<p>Kag: …………</p>
<p>TS: …………</p>
<p>Kag: …………</p>
<p>Back to Hikaru.</p>
<p>Chachamaru: OH MY GOD NOTHING IS HAPPENING. NOTHING AT ALL. Hikaru! What next?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hmm. It seems like it was a mistake on my part to allow Kageaki to do as he pleases.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou138.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" title="maou138" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou138.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Meaning…?</p>
<p>BACK TO KAGEAKI, FOR THE NTH TIME.</p>
<p><em>Classes have ended for the day.</em></p>
<p>Girl: Kageaki! Shall we go home together?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou140.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1529" title="maou140" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou140.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, she’s Kageaki’s childhood friend in this version of the dream.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Together…?</p>
<p>Girl: Yeah. Like we used to back then…</p>
<p>They used to live close to each other, but not anymore.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Right there! Time for some choices!</p>
<p>And she conjures up three dialogue choices for Kageaki. All three are basically different ways of agreeing to go home together.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Okay.</p>
<p>Girl: Awesome! I get to walk home together with Kageaki!</p>
<p>Later:</p>
<p>Kageaki: As I recall, you’ll have to turn right here to get to your place.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou143.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1526" title="maou143" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou143.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Girl: Yup!</p>
<p>Kageaki: And I’ll be taking the left. Goodbye, then.</p>
<p>Back to Hikaru.</p>
<p>Cha: DEAR GOD IS THIS A FUTILE EFFORT.</p>
<p>Hikaru: You really are something, Kageaki! Now that it’s come to this, I’ll use every possible tool at my disposal…!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou144.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1525" title="maou144" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou144.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou145.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1524" title="maou145" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou145.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou146.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1523" title="maou146" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou146.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou148.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1522" title="maou147" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou147.jpg" width="584" height="326"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1521" title="maou148" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou148.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou149.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1520" title="maou149" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou149.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou150.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1519" title="maou150" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou150.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/super-sonico-muramasa.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" title="super sonico muramasa" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/super-sonico-muramasa.png" width="584" height="547"></a></p>
<p>So she tries several more girls. Most of them are characters from other Nitro+ games… I think. Not being much of a VN reader myself, I only recognize Saya and Super Sonico at the end (who’s not even a VN character). If you can name all (or some) of the characters, feel free to do so in the comments section below. I’d be more than interested.</p>
<p>Kageaki: *suddenly wakes up*</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou153.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1516" title="maou153" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou153.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: What’s wrong? You should go back to sleep unless you want to be tired all day tomorrow.</p>
<p>In any case, the scene ends and the next morning Chachamaru informs the two of them that the plan for the day is to go out and have some fun.</p>
<p>They go to a nearby racing stadium, because today is the day of some sort of championship. Basically Chachamaru and Kageaki start nerding out about racing-related stuff while poor Muramasa is looking at them in utter confusion, probably unable to understand a single word of what they’re saying.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou154.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1515" title="maou154" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou154.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>A bit later, Kageaki notices Chachamaru gazing at the race, seemingly bored.</p>
<p>Kageaki: What’s wrong? You don’t seem to be enjoying the race.</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, nothing. I was simply enjoying the peace and quiet. Have you ever thought of what that really means? Even if you think it’s quiet, that’s never truly the case. There will always be sounds around you. In other words, peace and quite to me means simply listening to what I want to hear and blocking out everything else. Right now, all I can hear is the race before me, and your voice. That’s all I need to be at peace.</p>
<p>Mur: And what about me?!</p>
<p>Cha: Hmm. I suppose I’m merely indifferent towards your very existence.</p>
<p>Mur: *irritated tone* Why thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>Chachamaru then directs the discussion towards the events of the other day, when Kageak was facing off against Hikaru.</p>
<p>Cha: Suppose that when you lost sight of Hikaru… she didn’t actually disappear. Quite the opposite – you saw her true form.</p>
<p>Mur: I have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Kag: I’m afraid I’m quite lost as well. Are you by any chance implying that Hikaru was merely a mirage of sorts? An illusion?</p>
<p>Cha: A mirage…</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Cha: A mirage, huh…?</p>
<p><em>I wanted to ask her about everything. I wanted her to reveal her secrets, to tell me what she knew. If asked now, she might even reply with the truth. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to open my lips. I wonder why?</em></p>
<p><em>No, there was no need to ask that question. I knew very well the reason behind my silence.</em></p>
<p><em>I had the feeling that the truth was something that was better left unspoken.</em></p>
<p><em>It was instinct. A premonition of sorts. Upon asking that critical question and receiveing the answer… something would come to an end.</em></p>
<p>Cha: You’re pretty amazing, you know that? You are definitely cut out to be a hero. You should continue with your training as well. That way, you will be able to defeat her.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Just… who are you?</p>
<p>Cha: *giggles*</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, it seems like a different bunch of wannabe heroes have arrived.</p>
<p>Kageaki: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, of course, you can’t hear it. Here, let me help you.</p>
<p>She puts her hand on Kageaki’s chest. Kageaki, temporarily borrowing Chachamaru’s super hearing ability, overhears a bunch of dudes plotting to kill her (while seeing the same sort of weird purple vortex from the very end of Part 3. So that was Chachamaru.)</p>

<p>Kag: What just happened? Who were those people?</p>
<p>Cha: Just a bunch of terrorists, it seems. Aw man, seems like I really cannot afford to leave the house without my disguise on.</p>
<p>Mur: What was that all about?</p>
<p>Kag: We’re being targeted by terrorists.</p>
<p>Cha: No use waiting around here, then. Shall we go and take care of them?</p>
<p>So they’re about to go and do just that, when Chachamaru stops.</p>
<p>Cha: Seems like they acted faster than I expected.</p>
<p>Adn explosion is heard, and countless spectators are instantly killed. It was set up by the terrorists, obviously.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou157.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512" title="maou157" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou157.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Chachamaru runs off, but before leaving, instructs Muramasa to protect Kageaki at all costs.</p>
<p>Kageaki looks over the carnage and is filled with undiluted rage by the sight of the corpses of innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You bastards…! What is the meaning of this! Answer me!</p>
<p>Terrorist: How arrogant of you, Rokuhara! This is divine punishment!</p>
<p><em>For the moment, I did not even care about the fact that he mistook me for a Rokuhara agent.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Don’t give me that! Why did you involve innocents?! Aren’t you doing this for the sake of a better world? In that case, how could you resort to such lowly means?!</p>
<p>Terrorist: Hmpf. The demise of ten people today will save a hundred tomorrow! They should be honored to be able to act as sacrifices for such a goal! Those who would object to that are just as bad as the Rokuhara itself! With only a small amount of victims, we can eradicate the greater evil!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am not listening to another word of yours. Surrender at once and await your punishment.</p>
<p>Terrorist: Hah, you think we would subject ourselves to your mortal laws?! This is the will of god, and we operate under orders from our divine leader!</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………?</p>
<p>Chachamaru comes in and knocks him unconscious.</p>
<p>Cha: He meant the Ginseigou. These guys were part of a group called the Falling Star.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Are they a group of terrorists planning to overthrow the Shogunate?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou158.jpg"><img title="maou158" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou158.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Yeah, but that’s only half of the story. They’re actually a religious group. And the divine leader they idolize is none other than the Ginseigou, everyone’s favorite mass murderer.</p>
<p>Kageaki: That is madness! The Ginseigou cares little for overthrowing the Rokuhara. She kills everyone without distinction!</p>
<p>Cha: Yep, and in the minds of these extremists, that would be considered as a necessary sacrifice in order to “eradicate the greater evil”, as you’ve just heard.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Cha: So what now? You’re still planning to fight her?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes. There is no other way.</p>
<p><em>I will have to rid the world of her as soon as possible, before a tragedy like this could occur again.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Right-o. In that case, I’ll give you an opportunity.</p>
<p>Kageaki: An opportunity…?</p>
<p>Cha: Yep. A chance to kill her. Are you fully prepared, though…? Are you prepared to kill your own family?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p><em>Ashikaga Chachamaru promised to give me a chance to kill Hikaru. No doubt she is able to mobilize a large number of troops at will, but such power will not be enough to defeat the Ginseigou. And yet, I truly believe that she was not lying to me. She really will be able to provide me with an opportunity to take Hikaru’s life. That thought alone filled me with dread as well as anticipation.</em></p>

<p>Kag: How exactly do we plan to kill her? In her sleep?</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, nope, nothing like that. You can’t possibly kill her like that. It would only have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Kag: What? The opposite effect?</p>
<p>Mur: You’ve completely lost me.</p>
<p>Cha: You’ll understand soon enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou160.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509" title="maou160" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou160.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>“Your current actions will merely lead you to a dead end, Minato Kageaki. Take a step back and find another way. Stop this at once.”</em></p>
<p>Cha: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Cha: Shall we go?</p>
<p>Kageak: Right. Let’s go.</p>
<p><em>Chachamaru opened the door, and we stepped in. It was pitch black inside, an endlessly stretching black void of a room. Thankfully, my eyes got accustomed to it soon enough.</em></p>
<p><em>And then it struck me – deja vu.</em></p>
<p><em>I know this sight. I’ve seen it before.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Hi-hikaru…?</p>
<p>*faint sounds of painful breathing can be heard*</p>
<p>Kag: Is she… asleep?</p>
<p>Cha: No. She’s awake.</p>
<p><em>The light switch was turned on, and the room was suddenly enveloped by bright, artificial light.</em></p>
<p><em>A familiar scene. There was no way I wouldn’t recognize it. After all, I had spent countless days looking after her like this. Every single day, I dreamed of a future in which she was healthy. And every single day, I dreaded the possibility of her death. I desperately longed for a miracle that would make that painful sight disappear. At the same time, I constantly wished for a miracle that would let her stay alive for yet another day.</em></p>
<p><em>An image of utmost contradictions, prolonged for an entire year.</em></p>
<p><em>The very same image that is before my eyes right now.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: …………………..</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou161.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508" title="maou161" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou161.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Wh-what is the meaning of this? If this girl is Minato Hikaru, then who is the person masquerading as the Ginseigou?!</p>
<p>Cha: Who indeed…?</p>
<p>Mur: Don’t play games with me!</p>
<p>Cha: Sorry, sorry. But isn’t it obvious? The girl before you right now is the same girl who dons Muramasa and acts as the Ginseigou.</p>
<p>Mur: How is that possible?! How could someone as sick as her go into battle wearing a Tsurugi?!</p>
<p>Cha: I know it sounds absurd. But that is the truth. The same girl you see before you right now is the Ginseigou.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou162.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507" title="maou162" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou162.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Mur: Impossible…! How is she able to do that?!</p>
<p>Cha: By sleeping. When this Minato Hikaru is asleep, the entitiy known as the Ginseigou makes its appearance.</p>
<p>Mur: Wh-what is that supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Kag: She has a split personality…?</p>
<p>Cha: No. The Ginseigou you know isn’t a “personality”. I thoroughly investigated it.</p>
<p>Kag: You did what?</p>
<p>Cha: You see, at first I didn’t actually know of her illness. I merely thought she had a peculiar way of sleeping. So I investigated her condition and examined her brain waves during her sleeping state and while the Ginseigou was active.</p>
<p>Mur: Brain waves…?</p>
<p>Cha: It has to do with the circulation of blood in the brain. It’s a fairly new discovery, but I’m sure you’ve heard about it, Kageaki. In fact, you should know about this more than anyone, as a user of Muramasa. How else could you have the ability to rewrite people’s thoughts?</p>
<p>Cha: In any case, I examined her brain waves. And the result was the exact opposite of what I had expected. While the Minato Hikaru you see before you now is awake, the Ginseigou lies dormant.</p>
<p>Kageaki: …………..</p>
<p>Cha: It’s all a dream. The being known as the “Ginseigou” is merely a dream that she’s having. A dream conjured up in the very depths of her broken mind.</p>
<p>Mur: A dream…? Th-that’s ridiculous! There’s no way that could be true!</p>
<p>Cha: Are you sure you haven’t experienced something like this before? Hm, Kageaki?</p>
<p>Kageaki: …………..</p>
<p>Muramasa: Mi-midou…?</p>
<p><em>I recalled the events of that day.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506" title="maou163" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou163.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>I remember only being able to sense her presence very faintly. I was questioning whether or not she was really there, standing before me. If what Chachamaru is telling me is the truth… then it all makes sense.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: But… there’s no way it can be the truth! How on earth can she create a black hole like the one from the other day?</p>
<p>Cha: Simply put, it’s the state of the “empty mind”. People are made up of a variety of useless, unnecessary things. If getting rid of all those elements results in the Ginseigou, it’s no surprise no one can defeat her.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou164.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505" title="maou164" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou164.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Impossible!</p>
<p>Cha: Don’t be too amazed, though. This is no miracle. It’s merely a curse. A curse that comes with a price to be paid. Look at her – she’s slowly withering away. She can be kept alive using all the latest medical science, but it’s only temporary. Who knows how long she will last.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Y-you mean…</p>
<p><em>Two years ago, she recieved medical treatment. And although the the doctor arrived too late, he could at least prevent her condition from worsening. In other words, her current condition is…</em></p>
<p>Cha: The Ginseigou is rooted in a dream, and is therefore able to possess unimaginable power. However, that power has its cost – it’s using up the vitality of the real Minato Hikaru. If I had to guess, I’d say she can conjure up the Ginseigou only two more times at best.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Only two…? And after that…?</p>
<p>Cha: After that, it’s all over. For both the Ginseigou, and Minato Hikaru.</p>
<p><em>It will all be over. She will disappear from this world for good.</em></p>
<p><em>She will die.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Well then. What’s the plan, Kageaki?</p>
<p>Kageaki: W-what do you mean…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou165.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1504" title="maou165" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou165.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a>Cha: As you can see, I kept my promise. Here’s your chance to kill her. When she’s like this, even a kid could do it. Anyone could easily strangle her to death.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Cha: So then. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Kageaki: There’s… there’s no way I could…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou166.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" title="maou166" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou166.jpg" width="584" height="322"></a><em>The girl before me is Hikaru. My own blood. The same person I loved dearly and vowed to protect from all harm. How could I possiblty kill her now? It should be the exact opposite. It is my duty as a brother to protect her…!</em></p>
<p>Cha: Like I said, she can only call up the Ginseigou two more times. But that would also mean the death of countless innocents along the way. In that form, no one can defeat her. This is the only way to do it.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou… you don’t have to. I can…</p>
<p><em>I raised my hand to silence her. I didn’t want her to finish that sentence.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Back off, Tsurugi. I gave this opportunity to him. And only him. Kageaki, this is your decision alone. The final decision to kill Minato Hikaru has to come from you.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Cha: Too much for you? In that case, let me remind you of what a certain monk told you. If Minato Kageaki’s desire is the death of her sister… then the only way to do it is to discard the personality known as Minato Kageaki. That way, you can become a true hero and topple the tyrant known as the Ginseigou, for it is the will of the universe itself.</p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki. Discard your own self. Discard everything you are.</p>
<p><em>In order to save the world from the grim reaper known as the Ginseigou, I…</em></p>
<p><em>No. I cannot become a hero.</em></p>
<p><em>Minato Hikaru has to die. If the feelings of Minato Kageaki should become a hinderance to achieving that goal… in that case, those feelings should just be extinguished.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet…</em></p>
<p>*he has a flashback of all the times they spent together, mostly scenes from Chapter 5*</p>
<p>“Kageaki. Do you think… I could meet my father?”</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou169.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1500" title="maou169" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou169.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a>“One day, surely.”</p>
<p><em>She is still the very same sister from all those years ago. She didn’t change one bit. All the murders of the Ginseigou… to her, that was all merely a dream. She is completely innocent. Not a single shred of sin tainted her soul.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to kill her.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to discard my own self.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to become a hero…</em></p>
<p><em>…and kill her.</em></p>
<p>You actually do get a choice here. Can you become a hero and kill her, or not?</p>
<p>If you choose to “become a hero”, Kageaki kills Hikaru by snapping her neck, and the game declares very mysteriously that Chachamaru has won. Then you get a Game Over screen. This will become important in Janen Hen, so keep it in mind.</p>
<p>So instead, let’s go with the “I can’t become a hero/ I can’t kill her” choice and continue the story.</p>

<p>Kageaki: Ah…AHHHHHHHHHHH…!!</p>
<p>Crazed, he runs out of the room, carrying Hikaru.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou, wait!</p>
<p><em>The voices will not cease.</em></p>

<p><em>I have to escape to a place where the voices can’t reach me anymore. If no such place exists, I will continue to flee for all eternity, with Hikaru in my arms.</em></p>
<p>He runs away to a nearby forest, and after a while, Hikaru falls asleep in his arms. It is now nighttime.</p>
<p>You know what this means.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah… the wind sure feels nice.</p>

<p>Kageaki: Hikaru…</p>
<p>Hik: Is something wrong, Kageaki? Feel free to tell me. We’re family, after all. No matter what it is, I’m more than happy to listen.</p>
<p>Kag: Are you… are you merely a dream of the real Hikaru?</p>
<p>Hik: That’s right.</p>
<p><em>The girl before me was a dream. And yet, she didn’t seem like one. She possessed an unimaginable amount of power.</em></p>
<p>Hik: You find it strange? It does not appear that way to me. I’m absolutely content. In fact, this was my very own desire. Or rather, I should say… what I’ve always aspired to be.</p>
<p>Kag: And you realize that you’re a…</p>
<p>Hik: Yes, I do realize that I’m a dream. However, I rejoice in that fact. After all, this is a way for me to become a Minato Hikaru who surpasses the real one.</p>

<p>Hikaru: I am indeed her dream. I swear upon it. And I take pride in that fact, for it means that through me, her ideal self could manifest itself. This is the path I have chosen, the one I am willingly, boldly going to follow.</p>
<p><em>With those words, she turned her back on me once again.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: As the dream of Hikaru, it is my duty to grant her wish. To spread the way of war across this world!</p>
<p>Kageaki: N-no! Stop it! Any more and your life will be in danger! Your body-</p>
<p>Hik: …is at its limits? Is that it? I know. However, I shall not stop.</p>
<p>Kag: Hikaru!</p>
<p>Hik: This is the only way I know of. For me, no other path exists. For I am Hikaru’s dream, and nothing more. I exist for the purpose of granting her greatest desire.</p>

<p>Kag: You mean… reclaiming your father? You’re wrong! Akitaka never rejected you! You could meet him any time you wanted!</p>
<p>Hik: My wish is not merely to meet him. I want him to accept his role as a father, and ackowledge me as his daughter. However, you’re right. I could easily meet him, and call him father. And yet, I never once made the effort to do so. You see, I dread his rejection. So what do you think, Kageaki? Do you honestly believe you could grant me my wish?</p>
<p>Kag: ………………….</p>
<p>Flashback.</p>
<p>Elder: You’ll be the one to finish this.</p>
<p>Elder: You will have to personally sever any and all connection between Akitaka, this useless trash of man, and the Minato family!</p>

<p>Chief: Kageaki… forgive me…</p>
<p>Elder: Leave at once, Akitaka. Never again call yourself a member of the Minato family. Never show your face here ever again.</p>
<p>Chief: Kageaki… take care of Hikaru and the family for me…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/003_ev005_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1572" title="003_ev005_" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/003_ev005_.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Flashback to Subaru’s death:</p>
<p>Subaru: Kageaki. Take care of Hikaru… don’t you forget… our promise…</p>
<p>End of flashback.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……………………..</p>
<p>Hikaru: ………………………</p>
<p>The two look at each other in silence for a while.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Kageaki. All I wish for is to be accepted by him. To be shown love.</p>
<p>Hikaru: The bond of fatherly love was robbed of him by the world – in other words, all I have to do is destroy the world itself! And you are my greatest enemy, Kageaki. The final obstacle for me to overcome. When the time comes, everything will perish before me: you, and the entire world as well! Everything that stands in my way shall be swept away by the power I wield. No one can stop me.</p>

<p>And then she flies off, leaving Kageaki behind.</p>
<p>He chases after her, only to find yet another massacred village. Muramasa also catches up to him.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou, forigve me… I arrived too late…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou183.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1486" title="maou183" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou183.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>It wasn’t her fault. There was no need for her to apologize.</em></p>
<p>Kag: This is all my fault… all because I faltered…! All because I couldn’t kill her then!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Chachamaru shows up and lands a surprise attack on Muramasa.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou…! Quickly, say the words!</p>
<p>Kag: Meet a demon-</p>
<p>Cha: There is a way to save Hikaru’s life, you know.</p>
<p>Kag: …..?!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou184.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1485" title="maou184" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou184.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Mur: Don’t listen to her!!</p>
<p>Cha: By using this…</p>
<p>She takes out the egg she got earlier from Hikaru.</p>
<p><em>Suddenly, the entire world went silent, and all I could hear was the voice of Ashikaga Chachamaru.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou185.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1484" title="maou185" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou185.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>(Chachamaru’s voice turns somewhat muffled/metallic here, resembling the tone of a Tsurugi. Hmm. Not sure what to make of this just yet.)</p>
<p>Cha: You love Minato Hikaru from the bottom of your heart. Your utmost desire is for her to live. Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><em>That is…</em></p>
<p><em>…a fact I cannot deny. She’s right.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Nnnnooo…!!</p>

<p>Cha: Gotcha! Your heart belongs to me now!</p>
<p>Mur: Midou…!!</p>
<p>Cha: This egg exists to calm the hearts of men and make them obedient. Well then, Kageaki! Out with it! What is you greatest desire?</p>
<p><em>My… desire?</em></p>
<p><em>That should be obvious by now.</em></p>
<p>Mur: Midou—-!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou187.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1482" title="maou187" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou187.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>[end of scene]</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>The scene fades to black, and we get to read a lengthy article. This is the same research article that Kageaki read during Kanae’s route, except this time we get to read all of it. Or at least, more of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou188.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1481" title="maou188" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou188.jpg" width="584" height="330"></a></p>
<p>Basically, the article tries to answer the question of what a Tsurugi really is. Again, parallels are drawn between Tsurugi and living beings (much like in the article that Kageaki read in Kanae’s route. I recommend you go back and read it if you don’t remember.). As the blacksmith forges his armor to perfection, he submerges him- or herself in water along with it, and drowns. The scorching hot steel creates steam from the water, and once it all clears away, the blacksmith is nowhere to be found – all that remains is the completed Tsurugi. Up until now, researchers viewed the forged steel as teh main component of this process, and the water was merely the catalyst to trigger the union. However, what if it was the other way around? What is the hot steel was the catalyst, and the most essential ingredient to forging a Tsurugi was actually the water?</p>
<p>In order to support this claim, the article then goes on (referring to the research of Karl Haushofer) to point out a correlation between pockets of underground water in the eastern part of Eurasia and the production of Tsurugi. Basically, Tsurugi are produced where underground water is the most plentiful. To be more specific, we’re talking about the water beneath Eurasia. This is evidenced by the fact that other regions like North and South America, Africa, Australia and so on have not been able to manufacture Tsurugi, neither now, nor in the past. Up until now, this was explained by racial differences, or the difference in the quality of steel in other lands. Water was never included in such theories. They knew about the need for water in Tsurugi manufacturing, but never paid much attention to it, and never viewed it as the most essential component.</p>
<p>The main thesis of the article then is this: the underground water native to the continent of Eurasia (more specifically, its eastern part) is the key to solving the mystery of Tsurugi forging.</p>
<p>It goes on to say that he classifies Tsurugi as a separate species, or possibly subspecies, evidenced by them having a sentient will, and the fact that they need to replenish their strength by feeding on the calorific energy of their master. Opposing opinions were numerious, drawing attention to the fact that Tsurugi are loyal to their masters, making them similar to machines.</p>
<p>The next few pages are the ones Kageaki read during Kanae’s route, so i’ll just copy/paste them here for completion’s sake. If you’ve already read it, feel free to skip it. Or read it again if you want, just to refresh your memory. I’m gonna mark its beginning and end so you know which parts to skip.</p>
<p>[start]</p>
<p>Draining the energy of their wearer and thus sustaining themselves could be considered a sort of metabolism for them. He brings up a few counterexamples as well: for example, if Tsurugi are living beings, why do they obey their masters without question? That would make them machines. Additionally, they are incapable of reproduction. Despite that, the writer of the article (Wolf) is convinced that Tsurugi are living beings ・it is a possibilty that they are imperfect beings, hence why they can’t reproduce. He draws parallel between Tsurugi and a leopon (crossbreed of lion and leopard, look it up, it was new to me as well). Of course, he says, the method of reproduction in such a case is the forging process itself.</p>
<p>So, how do Tsurugi reproduce? The key, according to the article, is water. Or at least someting that is in water. Also, especially the water of eastern Asia. The article then goes on to paint a picture for us: imagine a cave in the depths of Asia, where the blaksmith is doing his forging business, enduring the heat and the pain. In the cave, there is an underground spring/pond/whatever. He submerges himself in it, and the cold water comes in contact with hot steel. The cave is englufed by steam. And then, that *something* contained within the water comes into contact with the steel and the blacksmith. They all become one, and a Tsurugi is born. It is a process akin to caterpillar fungi, who release their spores as parasites・into other living beings, mostly insects. (Remember that Ginseigou-affected Tsurugi are referred to as Kiseitai, meaining parasite? I wonder if there’s a connection between this and how Ginseigou seemingly reproduced in Chapter 4 with that egg.) The spores induce a miraculous transformation that turns insect into part mushroom, not unlike the blacksmith, who becomes a Tsurugi, a fusion of steel and human. The question is: during the Tsurugi forging process, what corresponds to the spores? The answer is simple: that *something* in the water that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>[end]</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou189.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1480" title="maou189" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou189.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Okay, so everything after this is new stuff, so don’t skip it.</p>
<p>In the country closest to these underground water sources (Yamato), a certain religious belief was rather prosperous amongst blacksmiths. The center of this religion was the god known as Konjin. This god appointed the proper time and season for blacksmiths to pursue their profession – this was relayed to them via priests and their divination techniques. This god is often referred to as a deity that arrived from the outside, from a foreign land. Which is rather peculiar, since previously it was thought that since the forging ceremony was inseperable from its religious implications, it would be a god native to Yamato.</p>
<p>The Konjin faith merged with Buddhism, and as a result, their god gained a new appearance as a Devil King (“Tyrant”) and was worshipped by the Tendai sect. The appearance of this Devil King is extremely unique. One might even call it bizarre. It is a non-human being that arrived on Earth 6.5 million years ago from Venus (written in Japanese as 金星, literally meaning “Silver Star”). It always appears as 16 years old, never aging, never changing.</p>
<p>Bishamonten and Kannon (originally Guanyin) are together called as Sonten, with the former symbolizing the sun and light, while the latter the moon and the heart. The Devil King (written as Maouson – 魔王尊) stands for the earth and power/strength.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Maouson is a non-human that came flying to Earth from Venus, like a meteorite, or falling star. However, it was no mere falling star. The legend of Maouson also speaks of a certain “something”, not unlike a living being. Something that remains unaging and unchanging for all eternity, like steel. Steel and life: in other words – Tsurugi. If we can assume that religion is partly grounded in reality, this would indicate the existence of life outside Earth that arrived here all the way from Venus. An eternal fusion of steel and life, more ancient and more perfect than any other Tsurugi. Could it be that this “God” is still slumbering beneath the surface of the earth, even today?</p>
<p>I envision the form of this god. At one time it takes to form of a person, at other times it is a large, crystallized entity.</p>
<p>The article then goes back to the issue of Tsurugi reproducing, and states that a “perfect” Tsurugi, inheriting the power of this god, would be capable of doing such a thing by means of using its “spores” or “parasites” that were mentioned before.</p>
<p>(I can kinda see where this is going. Remember that Hikaru could reproduce herself in Chapter 4 by implanting an egg into someone else. I’m just guessing here, but I think this has something to do with all that. I have no idea what it’s all supposed to signify, but I guess we’ll find that out sooner of later.)</p>
<p>The article laments that even though new-type Tsurugi are wonderful, they lack a certain something that traditional ones had. And thus, instead of getting closer to creating the perfect Tsurugi, researchers are actually getting farther away from this goal. So in order to further his research into the perfect Tsurugi, the writer of the article (Wolf) is determined to travel around the world, including the far-eastern island nation of Yamato.</p>

<p>Chachamaru: We’re almost there, Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kageaki lifts his gaze from the papers in front of him (so he was reading the above), and gazes out the window of the car he’s currently in. They’re getting closer to Fudaraku Castle, the headquarters of the Rokuhara Shogunate.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou192.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1477" title="maou192" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou192.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>We cut to the inside of the Rokuhara HQ.</p>
<p>Cha: Watch your heads! ‘Cuz here I come!</p>
<p>Utter silence.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou193.jpg"><img title="maou193" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou193.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Not a single word of greeting. You guys are unbelievably mean. T_T</p>
<p>So anyway, the Rokuhara bigwigs reunite and greet the returning Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Shishiku: I have to ask, though. Who the hell is that man you have with you?</p>
<p>Cha: Ah, let me introduce him. Starting today, he’s going to be my brand new partner – Lieutenant Minato Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Pleased to make your acquaintance.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou194.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1475" title="maou194" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou194.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Doushin: Hmm…</p>
<p>Raichou: Lieutenant…?</p>
<p>Cha: Nice to have you on board!</p>
<p>Shishiku: Wait a second. Minato? I don’t recall ever hearing that name before. What was his previous division?</p>
<p>Cha: He has no such thing. Until yesterday he was merely a civilian.</p>
<p>Shi: So how come he’s a Lieutenant all of a sudden?</p>
<p>Cha: I faked his papers, obviously.</p>
<p>Raichou: My god, you’re always like this! Completely irresponsible! Wait a second. Actually, I don’t recall you ever doing something like this in the past.</p>
<p>Cha: Because until I met him, there was no man who was worth going through that much trouble.</p>
<p>Shi: Oh…? So you’re implying he’s that sort of man?</p>
<p>Shi: What say you to that, Minato? Seems like your master has a rather high opinion of you.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………..</p>
<p>Shi: Not a word, huh? You got some nerve. Surely you know the consequences of an attitude like that. I have to admit, you have some balls.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am honored by your words, Your Excellency. However, a petty soldier like myself should not waste energy by replying to a trivial question like that. Even if I had opened my lips to respond to your question, nothing I might have said could’ve changed your mind. Therefore, I refrained from replying.</p>
<p>Shi: In other words… you’re basically telling me that I shouldn’t ask pointless questions.</p>
<p>Kag: Indeed. Very well observed, Your Excellency.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou195.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1474" title="maou195" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou195.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Everyone in the room is speechless.</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>……..</p>
<p>Shi: Not bad. Not bad at all. I like this man already.</p>
<p>He lunges at Kageaki, who deflects his blade perfectly.</p>
<p>Doushin: Lord Shishiku!</p>
<p>Shishiku: Worry not. I was not seriously after his life.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou196.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1473" title="maou196" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou196.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Shishiku: Not bad at all. Minato… Kageaki, was it?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Indeed. I am humbled that you remembered, Your Excellency.</p>
<p>Shi: Hmpf. You have some balls. And you are starting to get on my nerves. I like you. *villanious laughter*</p>
<p>Raichou: You’re a weird one, you know that?</p>
<p>Shi: I don’t want to hear that from the likes of you. Chachamaru! Answer me – where did you come across a man like him?</p>
<p>Cha: Oh, I just picked him out from a group of our enemies.</p>
<p>Shi: Oh…? So he used to be a rebel, then? How did you end up convincing him to join us?</p>
<p>Cha: I wouldn’t say he was a rebel. Has wasn’t an ally of the Shogunate, but he wasn’t especially interested in overthrowing it, either. It’s just that he happened to come into confrontation with the Shogunate more often than your average man. I merely explained to him that his and the Shogunate’s interests coincided, and he joined up.</p>
<p>Shi: So, you already have some sort of plan in mind, huh…?</p>
<p>Cha: Yup! It’s a secret, though.</p>
<p>Shi: Chachamaru, hand this man over to me. I will take him under my wing. I’ll even give you an entire batallion in return.</p>
<p>Cha: Never~</p>
<p>Raichou gets all worked up over the fact that they would accept a previous rebel into their ranks, but in the end, the others manage to convince him to calm down.</p>
<p>Raichou: Hear me, Lieutenant Minato! I will not say another word now, but don’t think you’re off the hook! I will be watching you.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193639/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou197.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472" title="maou197" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/maou197.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: You honor me. Truly, only your beauty and grace exceeds your wisdom.</p>
<p>Raichou: ………!</p>
<p>Raichou: O-oh my. It seems like you have an eye for discerning true beauty. I will accept you… for now.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am in your debt.</p>
<p>The scene ends, and so does this update, because it’s gotten really damn long.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Wow, this chapter was really strong. I will not dwell much into it, but this one was the one that made me think really hard. All the things happening at the same time are really difficult for Kageaki, Chachamaru as misterious as ever, and Hikari is really an awesome character, we also can’t forget Muramasa that actually didn’t appear that much in this chapter. And DAT cliffhanger at the end!!!</p>
<p>Thanks for your hard work, garejei!</p>
<p>P.S: The characters that appear in the Dream part are indeed from another Nitro+ games. Some examples:<br>

<p>Meanwhile, I suddenly realized (because I’ve previously seen screenshots of her) that the girl holding the stuffed bunny in the dream sequence was from Gekkou no Carnevale, another VN that I’m planning to read sometime in the future.</p>
<p>And the cliffhanger was intentional. Obviously. <img src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 4 _ gareblogs_files/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
