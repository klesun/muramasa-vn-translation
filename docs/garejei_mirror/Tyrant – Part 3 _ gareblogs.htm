<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Tyrant</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Part 3</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Note:</strong> This project is a fairly old work of mine, written and translated back in 2012, when I was still just starting out as a fan translator — as such, it’s not exactly the highest quality work I’ve ever put out, to say the least. I would’ve deleted it long ago, but since people still seem to be interested in it, I decided to keep it, but felt the need to give this quick warning beforehand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span id="more-1378"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.wordpress.com/2012/10/21/full-metal-daemon-muramasa-plot-summarytranslation-tyrant-part-2/">Back to Muramasa’s route, Part 2</a></p>
<p>So we’re back at the prince’s residence, who asks Kageaki to assassinate Ashikaga Moriuji. Our goal would be to get him out of the picture, then create a new Rokuhara that would be a strong union of the Imperial Court and the previous Rokuhara. The presence of a strong Shogunate in Yamato would also foil the GHQ’s plans (we’ve already gone through the GHQ’s plans a million times in the other routes, so I don’t think I need to explain it again.).</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1383" title="maou42" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou42.jpg" width="584" height="322"></a></p>
<p>The big difference here is the fact that now Kageaki has fully accepted Muramasa’s “death upon good and evil” law, so this time he doesn’t shy away from the mission and actually accepts the prince’s offer to kill Moriuji. However, he warns him that in return, he will have to kill the prince as a sacrifice due to Muramasa’s “curse”. (Although now that we’ve fully understood what it’s about, I’d rather not call it a curse.). The prince selflessly accepts, but Chief interrupts and offers his own life instead. Kageaki hesitates for a few seconds, but since his resolve is now strengthened (along with his bond with Muramasa), he accepts. The other major reason why he accepts the mission is because the assassination would take place at the Hachimangu Shrine, during some sort of ceremony – and as it happens, it’s the same place Hikaru had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Later, we’re back at Kageaki’s residence, who, along with Muramasa, is planning how to get into the Hachimangu, or more specifically, how to get close enough to Moriuji to be able to kill him. After some speculation, they conclude that Kageaki will have to disguise himself as a priest and join Moriuji during the ceremony, become one of his attendants and kill him like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou43.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1384" title="maou43" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou43.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Sounds simple enough. So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>Kageaki: You are.</p>
<p>So they discuss different means to smuggle Muramasa into the Shrine, but dismiss all ideas as too dangerous.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Wait a second. What if I disguised myself as a priest as well?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Can’t say I’ve ever heard of an arachnid priest.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Ah, of course, you wouldn’t know. You weren’t there and didn’t see what Mother did… hmm… let’s give it a try, shall we?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..?</p>
<p>Muramasa: If I’m not mistaken, Mother did it like this…</p>
<p>Kageaki: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Muramasa: I’ll try to transform myself to how I looked back then.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Back then…?</p>
<p>Blinding white light engulfs the room.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Look, Midou! I did it! This is what I looked like when I was still mortal…!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou44.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1385" title="maou44" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou44.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Um…</p>
<p>We then cut to Moriuji, meeting with the prince. They bring one of the prince’s men before him, accused of treason. The prince is nervous (obviously it was his underling) but feigns ignorance and hands the man over to Moriuji (he basically has no other choice).</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou45.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1386" title="maou45" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou45.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Raichjou is also in the room, who promptly takes the rebel to a neighboring room and executes him. Moriuji laughs like a villain, clearly aware of the rebel’s true identity and the prince’s involvement. We then see him leave Fudaraku and head towards the Shrine.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou46.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1387" title="maou46" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou46.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>We’re back at Hachimangu with Kageaki and Chief. Muramasa comes back, now in her human form, to inform them that she’s made the necessary preparations for the mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou47.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1388" title="maou47" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou47.jpg" width="584" height="329"></a>Kageaki is rendered speechless by her sudden change of appearance.</p>
<p>Chief: Kageaki. What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am just as baffled as you are.</p>
<p>Kageaki: *poke poke poke*</p>
<p>Muramasa: Kyah-! Wh-what are you doing?! S-stop it, I’m ticklish…! Ah…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: So soft…</p>
<p>Muramasa: Stop saying embarrassing things!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1389" title="maou48" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou48.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>So anyway, after the hijinks, they go off to begin preparing for the assassination, and we cut to the streets of Kamakura with Moriuji (on his way to the shrine, I guess) randomly bumping into Chachamaru.</p>
<p>Moriuji: Ah, Chachamaru. What brings you here?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" title="maou49" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou49.jpg" width="584" height="330"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Sightseeing.</p>
<p>Mor: Your role is to protect the city in case of an attack. Do not neglect your duty. Return to your post.</p>
<p>Cha: Don’t be so stiff, old man! It could even lead to constipation, you know! I’ll totally go home once I look around a bit more.</p>
<p>Mor: But…</p>
<p>Cha: Being at the mansion is no fun, all we ever do is listen to reports! If only an enemy would attack, it would at least liven things up a bit! But they won’t ever come. Wait, I’m getting distracted. What if I should become said enemy? My, wouldn’t that be crazy! Come at me, old man, if you wanna stop me, this is your chance~</p>
<p>Mor: Chachamaru. You might be young, but you *are* a high ranking member of the Shogunate all the same. You should behave accordingly.</p>
<p>Cha: The same goes for you, pops. Look at me, I’m good ol’ Chachamaru! What were you expecting from me, honestly?</p>
<p>Mor: *sigh*</p>
<p>Cha: I’ll go home soon, I promise!</p>
<p>Mor: Very well. Although, I can hardly say there would be anything worth seeing around here.</p>
<p>Cha: You’re telling me. But it was her wish that we come out here, so I couldn’t really raise any objections.</p>
<p>Mor: Her…? Ah, you mean that woman who goes by the name Yuutsuzu. Her health seemed to be on the decline when I last saw her during the spring. I take it she’s getting better?</p>
<p>Cha: Not really. But she asked me so nicely that I just couldn’t refuse. In fact, we brought her doctor along with us. See that car over there?</p>
<p>Mor: Hmm. I see. As far as I’ve heard, a variety of rumors are afloat regarding that woman…</p>
<p>Cha: You mean the ones about her being my mother?</p>
<p>Mor: Indeed. Although, considering your troublesome attitude, I don’t see how anyone could come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>Cha: Not to mention, you know better than anyone where my mother is right now, don’t you?</p>
<p>Mor: Of course. My previous remark was but a jest, pay no heed to it.</p>
<p>Cha: Well, I suppose the reason I do whatever she tells me is… hmm, because I’m too infatuated with her to be able to say no?</p>
<p>Mor: ……..</p>
<p>Cha: What’s wrong?</p>
<p>Mor: I had been planning to wed you to Shirou one day, but… could it be that you actually prefer…</p>
<p>Cha: Hey now, boss. What’s with the stern look?</p>
<p>Mor: Nevermind. Forget what I just said.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1391" title="maou50" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou50.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Like I needed to be asked to forget an accusation like that! Trust me, I love dicks just as much as the next girl! Though I’ve yet to actually see one!</p>
<p>Mor: Keep your voice down, for God’s sake!</p>
<p>(Gotta love Chachamaru.)</p>
<p>In any case, we then cut back to Kageaki and Muramasa, disguised as priests and accompanying Moriuji into the inner shrine.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou52.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1393" title="maou52" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou52.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>“He is an immensely powerful man.” That single thought dominated my mind as I took a good look at Ashikaga Moriuji. He, without a doubt, possesses unbelievable strength. Physical as well as mental – he was powerful, in every sense of the word. He was a tyrant, a man standing atop the Rokuhara Shogunate, holding the nation of Yamato firmly in his iron grip while crushing all insurgents with unprecedented ferocity. However, his qualities as a ruler were undeniable.</em></p>
<p><em>Six years ago, in an outrageous show of betrayal, the Rokuhara sold out their very own nation in order to bring the Great War to a close. What followed was a regime built upon brute strength, spearheaded by the Shogunate – the textbook example of military despotism. However, what were the alternatives? Without the firm military rule of the Rokuhara, Yamato would have been engulfed in the flames of war that were, at the time, spreading across the mainland still. While the Rokuhara’s government during the past six years can hardly be called one without flaws, they did manage to protect Yamato from being the target of foreign military operations. Historians of future generations might look back upon the Rokuhara’s rule and acknowledge their methods as the best possible option available at the time.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: *thinking* I certainly wouldn’t want a read a history book like that, though…</p>
<p><em>While me and everyone else living in this age would disagree with such a seemingly outrageous statement, I have no doubts that historians of future periods could easily arrive at such a conclusion via objectively considering the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>I will have to murder Ashikaga Moriuji. Here and now. However, one could see how that single action could lead to the gradual downfall of the entire nation of Yamato.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: *thinking* What should I do…? Kill him… or spare him?</p>
<p>Eventually, Moriuji comments on the inner shrine and how it’s supposed to be a shrine to a god of the Emishi, a herald of a new world. In his answer, Kageaki makes a mistake and Moriuji figures out that he and Muramasa are not priests at all.</p>
<p>Moriuji: What guides your hand, assassin? Loyalty to the prince? Or the promise of riches and rewards?</p>
<p>Kageaki interrupts him.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Before I do anything, I must pose a question to you.</p>
<p>Mor: Oh? The assassin would dare indulge in conversation with his prey?</p>
<p>Kageaki: My single question is this: what sort of a ruler are you?</p>
<p>Mor: I reign supreme. I live to conquer, and act only to subdue my enemies.</p>
<p>Kageaki: If supreme rule is your desire, you should know better than anyone that that goal has already been accomplished.</p>
<p>Mor: Not yet. There remains an enemy that has yet to bend to my will.</p>
<p>Kageak: In other words… the GHQ.</p>
<p>Mor: Do you honestly believe a ruler such as I would let those pigs grow fat on Yamato’s pastures? No. It is high time we sent them back to the other side of the ocean, all the way to the very hole they crawled out of.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Our prospects of victory against them are dim at best.</p>
<p>Mor: And yet, I *will* emerge as the victor. This is not the same country it was six years ago. Back then, our only option was to forge a temporary alliance with them. Today… things are different. I will seize victory, even if I have to sacrifice half the population!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou56.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1397" title="maou56" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou56.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a>Kagaeki basically calls him a madman but Moriuji replies that he doesn’t give a fuck about Yamato as long as he can rule. He then calls his Tsurugi. Muramasa morphs back into her armor form and they have a lengthy battle, which ends with Moriuji escaping towards the surface. Kageaki panics, knowing that Moriuji emerging outside the shrine means he’ll be joining up with his hundreds of personal guard waiting outside. Which is bad news.</p>
<p>However, when Kageaki catches up to him outside, the two of them are greeted by a horrific sight. Everyone that was in the temple is dead, with their corpses littering the ground as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou57.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1398" title="maou57" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou57.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Moriuji: Wh-what is the meaning of this…?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou…</p>
<p>The prince’s carriage is before them, and they witness as slowly, a person emerges from it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou57-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1399" title="maou57.5" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou57-5.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Moriuji: You are… wait a moment. You are Lady Yuutsuzu, no doubt. What happened here?! Where is your master?</p>
<p>???: How rude of you to arrive after the curtain has already closed upon this performance. Their dance was truly a sight to soothe the spirit. And yet… their art is but a solitary flower, its beauty fleeting; doomed to have its petals scattered in the wind, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>???: Hmm. It is hardly a thing to be mourned – for a flower can be made to bloom once again. Let us dance then, dear brother, with grace surpassing theirs! You know I cannot take no for an answer… Kageaki!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou58.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1400" title="maou58" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou58.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru…</p>
<p>Moriuji: Answer me!</p>
<p>Hikaru: *in an irritated tone* What? Unless you have some important business with me, I would appreciate it if you didn’t interrupt our family reunion.</p>
<p>Moriuji: Are you blind, woman? Explain yourself!</p>
<p>Hikaru: I was the one who did it.</p>
<p>Moriuji: You did… what?</p>
<p>Hikaru: *mumbling to herself* It’s like I’m talking to a wall…</p>
<p>Hikaru: Let me remind you, then. You ordered me to explain myself. I just told you I was responsible for what you see here before you.</p>
<p>Moriuji: Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p>Hikaru: How rude!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Of course she is…</p>
<p>Hikaru: *to Kageaki* Hearing that from you really hurts, you know…</p>
<p>In any case, she dons her armor and addresses Moriuji once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou59.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1401" title="maou59" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou59.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1402" title="maou60" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou60.jpg" width="584" height="324"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou61.jpg"><img title="maou61" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou61.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p>Hikaru: Ashikaga Moriuji. I have come to pose a question to you. You walk the same path as I, spreading havoc across the land of Yamato. I wish to hear your definition of supremacy!</p>
<p>Moriuji: You wish to know of the path I follow? It is the road of ultimate conquest! To seize the entire land for myself, to crush all those who oppose me! I desire the world itself, therefore, the world itself will bend its knee to me! Like so!</p>
<p>He unleashes a powerful attack towards Hikaru.</p>
<p>Moriuji: I wasn’t planning on taking your head, woman. However, if you insist on standing in my way, you *will* be crushed.</p>
<p>Hikaru: I see, I see. Very good, I approve! Supremacy means taking what you want by force, with your own two hands! The land of Yamato, for example.</p>
<p>Mor: Hmpf. I have no particular interest in Yamato alone. Any other country would do fine. I have seized control of Yamato merely because I happened to be born on her soil.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Wait a second. Are you telling me… that your actions are not driven by love?!</p>
<p>Clearly upset, she lands a fierce attack on Moriuji.</p>
<p>Hikaru: How disappointing. Now you’ve made me look like a complete fool!</p>
<p>Mor: Wh-what manner of-</p>
<p>Hikaru: Stop interrupting me!!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou62.jpg"><img title="maou62" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou62.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Another attack from Hikaru.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Supremacy walks hand in hand with conquest – in other words, seizing what you desire by force. In this, you are correct. However! What feeling is at the root of all this? Desire! Longing! And what exactly is it that makes you long for something? Love!</p>
<p>Hikaru: You desire. You long. You love! And therefore, following that desire, you seize and conquer!</p>
<p>She punches the shit out of Moriuji once again.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Without desire, there remains nothing but vanity! In other words, you simply wanted the intoxicating glory of conquest! The only thing playing in your mind on repeat is “Look how awesome I am for conquering this entire land, look!”, am I right?!</p>
<p>She then punches him again, and he finally flies off towards the the nearby forest and escapes.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Pfft. What an absolute waste of my time.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Sorry for making you wait. You’re looking great today, just pumping with energy! Not just you, but your Tsurugi as well. Well then, let our dance begin, Kageaki – a dance of longing, seizing, conquering as we savor each other’s souls!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou63.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1405" title="maou63" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou63.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: What exactly it is that you hope to accomplish with this…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Oh? Very well, I shall give you an answer. My wish… is to spread the basic principle of war across this land!</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Conflict. Strife. Violence. Murder. Call it what you will. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about, Kageaki. You comprehend the true meaning of Muramasa, after all. I shall let the world bask in the brilliant light of the truth I carry – all in order to bring about a new age!</p>
<p>Kageaki: A new age? No new age awaits this land, Hikaru. All that will be left is death and utter destruction.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Exactly! Once the world is completely consumed by the flames of violence, all those who remain will have the right to take the name of gods and ascend to the heavens!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Madness!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou64.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1406" title="maou64" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou64.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a>Hikaru: Wh-what? Did I say something weird? Surely not. You see, there is no other way to become a god. So name the entire world as your foe and emerge victorious! And through the song of Muramasa, I can force my own mentality on all those who listen. I shall build a mountain by spreading the true way of war to every heart and soul – at its summit, my long-cherished desire will finally be granted.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your desire…?</p>
<p><em>Did she have yet another goal aside from what she had just described…?</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: I’ve already mentioned it countless times. Surely you remember.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……….</p>
<p>Kageaki: Love.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Yes. As long as the soul is illuminated by its flame, the body, too, shall be as steel.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Are you implying that the reason you make countless men and women murder each other… is due to your love towards them?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah, if only that were the case. I’m afraid my love is not quite magnificent enough to envelop all the people of this land. No, this feeling I hold so dearly within my heart targets only a single person.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Um, Kageaki. I can’t believe you’re making me say these things. I know you’re family and all, but it really makes a girl uneasy when she has to open up and reveal her innermost feelings to someone else.</p>
<p>Kageaki: You’ve lost your mind…</p>
<p>Hikaru: I haven’t!</p>
<p>Kageaki: You have! You are insane! Broken beyond repair! I don’t know who *you* are. What I do know is that the sister I loved died two years ago with the rest of the village.</p>
<p>Hikaru: But I am completely sane.</p>
<p>Kageaki: I am not listening to another word of yours.</p>
<p>Hikaru: You should. You see, I knew from the very beginning what sort of Tsurugi Muramasa was. I joined forces with her in full possession of that knowledge. And it was I who made you choose Muramasa as well – all in order to have you murder Mother!</p>
<p>Kageaki: What… did you just say?! HIKARU!!</p>
<p>We then abruptly cut to a nearby forest with a wounded Moriuji being approached by Chachamaru.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou65.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1407" title="maou65" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou65.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Moriuji: So, the Ginseigou’s accomplice was you, after all… Tell me! Why did you rebel against me? Were you discontent with my ways?</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Not really. I love both you and the Rokuhara.</p>
<p>Moriuji: Then why did you turn against me? Have you forgotten who took you under his wings after you murdered your parents?</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Not at all! I’m absolutely in your debt, I know that. But you see, I didn’t actually do anything. It was all her.</p>
<p>Mor: Her…?</p>
<p>Chachamaru: Ginseigou. In fact, killing you will only add to my problems.</p>
<p>Mor: In that case… what are you planning to do now? You served under the Shogunate! For what reason could you possibly ally yourself with that madwoman?</p>
<p>Cha: Mad…? Ah, I suppose she’s quite the fool alright, taking on the entire world for the sake of her one true love. But that’s exactly why I fell for her. I’d rather follow a fool who does what she wants to do instead of a wise sage who sits around doing nothing. Plus, she can make my own wish come true as well.</p>
<p>Mor: Your own wish…?</p>
<p>Cha: God.</p>
<p>Moriuji: Oh? Have you become obsessed with such foolish nonsense?</p>
<p>Cha: H-hey! It’s a rather, um, personal issue to me! God is closer to me than you think, constantly screaming my ear off!</p>
<p>Moriuji: Hmpf. You might carry the Ashikaga blood in you, but your other half is that of a baseborn Emishi! I should’ve known that you would end up like this.</p>
<p>Cha: Seems like you truly knew nothing about me, old man.</p>
<p>Mor: …..?</p>
<p>Cha: Or maybe you knew, but didn’t want to believe it?</p>
<p>Mor: ……….</p>
<p>Cha: You see… you were wrong about me. I’m not actually a half-human, half-Emishi.</p>
<p>Mor: What point is there to hiding your true bloodline at a time like this? Die, traitor!</p>
<p>Moriuji had it with her and is about to strike her down. Chachamaru replies by taking out her own Tsurugi and deflecting Moriuji’s blow.</p>
<p>Cha: Farewell, old man. You were more of a parent to me than my actual father.</p>
<p>And then she kills him.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou66.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1408" title="maou66" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou66.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Cha: You’ve said so yourself. The Grim Reaper comes for us all eventually – even for kings.</p>
<p>Mor: It appears that my very own words… were my undoing…</p>
<p>And he dies for good. We then switch back to Kageaki and Hikaru. Kageaki does the same Falcon Punch attack he did in Ichijou’s route, and seemingly defeats Hikaru.</p>

<p>Muramasa: We… won?!</p>
<p><em>Did I… win? Did I do it, at long last?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou67.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409" title="maou67" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou67.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a></p>
<p><em>I did it.</em></p>
<p><em>I did… something unforgivable.</em></p>
<p>He is then punched in the face from above.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou68.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1410" title="maou68" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou68.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: An attack? How? By who?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Splendid! You utterly exceeded my expectations, Kageaki! I take back all of my previous remarks!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou69.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1411" title="maou69" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou69.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki is astonished that his most powerful attack didn’t kill her.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Was my attack ineffective after all…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ineffective? Don’t be ridiculous! Look!</p>
<p>She points at her chest and the tiny crack in her armor.</p>
<p>Hikaru: This is the very first time anyone has been able to inflict a wound upon me! This feeling… is unbelievable! My heart is aflutter! My entire body is trembling!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ahh~ So this is the joy of doing battle!</p>
<p>Muramasa and Kageaki conclude that up to now, Hikaru has been using a protective barrier to protect herself. Maintaining this barrier required energy, which means that up until now, she hasn’t been using 100% of her offensive powers. All the destruction she caused so far? Yeah, she was holding back. Her actual power is even more fearsome than that, apparently.</p>
<p>So basically Hikaru plays ping pong with his body for a while, teleporting around him with inhuman speed – so fast that Kageaki doesn’t even have time to react.</p>
<p><em>I recalled the words of my foster father – the man who taught me how to wield a sword.</em></p>
<p><em>“Free yourself from everything. Sight. Hearing. Smell. The entire world.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Empty your mind.”</em></p>
<p>Reinvigorated by those thoughts, he charges at Hikaru once again.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru! HIKARU–!!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah…! That’s it, Kageaki! Say my name! Scream it! Whisper it! Sing it! Ah, your voice is simply irresistible! I don’t think I’ll be able to control myself any longer…!</p>

<p>Muramasa: This is bad news! Midou, we must flee at once!</p>
<p><em>The air around us was swerwing, as if being in the middle of a tropical heat wave.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me.</em></p>
<p><em>Space itself… was being distorted.</em></p>
<p>Kageak: What… is this?!</p>
<p>Muramasa: The world itself is changing…</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou74.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1416" title="maou74" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou74.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>A dumbfounded Muramasa answered by desperate question.</em></p>
<p><em>No. It was I who answered her question.</em></p>
<p><em>And the question itself came from one of the other Muramasas.</em></p>
<p><em>Just what the hell is going on here?!</em></p>
<p><em>Space itself was melting. Time itself was melting.</em></p>
<p>The world warps before Kageaki’s eyes, and day transforms into night almost instantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou75.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1417" title="maou75" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou75.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a>Hikaru: Well then…</p>
<p><em>She sang with a voice that could bend the entire universe to its will.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: “<em>Black Hole Fairies.</em>“</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou76.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1418" title="maou76" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou76.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>(The kanji written here is the “hungering empty space” I mentioned waaay back in Kanae’s route, if you remember. However, she pronounces it in English as Black Hole, so I suppose my previous guess was correct regarding its meaning.)</p>
<p>Muramasa: Midou!!</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m being sucked in…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Muramasa..!! We have to break away! Use every single ounce of your power!!</p>
<p>Muramasa: Affirmative!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou77.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" title="maou77" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou77.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p><em>I cannot escape from its pull.</em></p>
<p><em>I finally comprehended the magnitude of this black hole’s power.</em></p>
<p><em>There was no way I could escape from its pull. It was futile. No matter how hard I try, the result would be the same.</em></p>
<p>Muramasa: We’re being swallowed up!</p>
<p><em>It wasn’t only us being pulled into this. It was the entire land around us – the ground, the air, the trees, the corpses.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: I’ll tear it apart.</p>
<p>Muramasa: What?! How?!</p>
<p>Kageaki: If there is no way out… the only thing left to do is to resort to sheer power! I’m tearing everything to pieces!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou78.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420" title="maou78" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou78.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p><em>It was useless. The very sword I was holding a second ago, determined to rend everything in its path including Hikaru, was swallowed up by the darkness. There was nothing in my hands anymore. Light itself was being devoured by this insatiable void.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru: How do you like the void I have created, Kageaki? Wielding such power, I shall ascend to the heavens and become god!</p>
<p>Kageaki: God…?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Have you forgotten already, Kageaki? It was you who taught me this. If someone goes against her mother to seize her father, she goes against the laws of humans. However, gods are governed by their own laws, and therefore make such a thing possible. I shall transcend humanity itself and become god! Father is chained down by the world of men. However, by becoming a god, it will be within my power to crush that world and release him from Mother’s embrace! That is the path I am determined to follow!</p>
<p><em>Her father…?</em></p>
<p>Flashback time.</p>
<p>Elder: Akitaka… have you entered my life only to disappoint me?</p>
<p>Elder: Makimura was the name, if I remember correctly? To think you would associate yourself with such a useless, lowly woman. Have you no self-respect?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou79.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1421" title="maou79" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou79.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Elder: The brutish thing I am about to do is merely in order to correct *your* failings. Consider it your just deserts.</p>
<p>Chief: You are right, elder… however…!</p>
<p>Elder: Hold your tongue! At this point, whatever you might have to say has less worth in my eyes than piss! Kageaki. Come over here.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Elder: Kageaki. Know that I bear no ill will towards you whatsoever. It truly pains me that it has come to this. However, you will have to personally sever any and all connection between Akitaka, this useless trash of a man, and the Minato family!</p>
<p>Chief: Kageaki… forgive me…</p>
<p>Back to the present.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Akitaka… Subaru…</p>
<p>Kageaki: Hikaru… you… you are…</p>
<p><em>And with those words, my consciousness faded to complete and utter darkness.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou80.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1422" title="maou80" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou80.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>We then briefly cut to Wolf and Jouan talking about the coming of god, saying how everything has led up to this moment, including the Rokuhara, the GHQ and Ginseigou. “Once the black whirpool/black hole appears, god will descend” or something along those lines. Jouan replies with an “Amen” and we cut to Chief. I really should start calling him Akitaka.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou81.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1423" title="maou81" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou81.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Akitaka: That… was Hikaru? The silver star? The same daughter that *she* gave birth to…?</p>
<p>And the scene ends.</p>
<p>We get antoher flashback, with Kageaki reading a book to young Hikaru about the gods of Yamato. She is about to fall asleep.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou82.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424" title="maou82" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou82.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: Hey. Don’t fall asleep now.</p>
<p>Hikaru: But I want to hear about something else…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: In that case, maybe you should pay more attention at school.</p>
<p>Hikaru: But that guy is so boring! He doesn’t even care if we listen or not so I always doze off…</p>
<p>Kageaki: First of all, don’t call your teacher “that guy”. Show some respect and attend your classes with dignity. Finally, my stories aren’t meant to be lullabies, you know. Your grades will suffer if you don’t listen to the lectures. Remember that one day you’ll succeed your mother – it will only embarrass you if you aren’t knowledgeable about these things.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Okay…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’ll continue.</p>
<p>Hikaru: No, tell me another story!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Like what?</p>
<p>Hikaru: How about some other gods?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Gods of other lands…? There won’t be much of a difference between their religion and ours. Only the gods have different names.</p>
<p>He then tells him about Greek gods and such, starting with Chaos, Eros and so on.</p>
<p>Kageaki: See? It doesn’t differ in too many things from our religion.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Actually, it does quite a bit…</p>
<p>Kageaki: I suppose it’s all a matter of interpretation.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Read more!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Alright. Uranus and Gaia’s union gave birth to two giants – Cyclopes and Hekatonkheires. However, Uranus came to hate the two giants, and cast them down to Tartarus.</p>
<p>Hikaru: What a meanie.</p>
<p>He goes on for a bit. Look up the Greek family tree on Wikipedia if you’re interested, he’s not saying anything new.</p>
<p>Hikaru: I like this story! Go on! Read more!</p>
<p>Kageaki: No more. We’ll have to return to studying Yamato.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Read moooore~</p>
<p>Kageaki: Another time.</p>
<p>Hikaru: ……….</p>
<p>Kageaki: Pouting will get you nowhere.</p>
<p>Hikaru: I have a question, then.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Go on.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Uranus and Gaia were married and had children, right?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Yes.</p>
<p>Hikaru: But… it was Gaia who gave birth to Uranus, no?</p>
<p>Kageaki: That is… correct.</p>
<p>Hikaru: So, the son married his mother?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Indeed.</p>
<p>Hi: Isn’t that wrong?</p>
<p>Kageaki: For humans, it is.</p>
<p>Hi: So for gods, it’s okay?</p>
<p>Ka: Gods have their own rules, I suppose.</p>
<p>Hi: I see…</p>
<p><em>“If someone goes against her mother to seize her father, she goes against the laws of humans. However, gods are governed by their own laws, and therefore make such a thing possible. I shall transcend humanity itself and become god! Father is chained down by the world of men.

<p><em>Father…</em></p>
<p><em>Your wish is to reclaim your father, Hikaru. You told me that much.</em></p>
<p><em>In reality, however, your father doesn’t “exist”.</em></p>
<p><em>Father opposed the rules of society. He discarded his identity as a father.</em></p>
<p><em>Undoubtedly, this is not what he had wished for. However, the laws of men dictate that such a man can no longer be a “father”.</em></p>
<p><em>Eventually, though, he decided to abide by the rules of society. Which is why he ended up never showing his face in front of Hikaru ever again.</em></p>
<p><em>I deeply considered the agony of the man I regarded as my foster father.</em></p>
<p><em>And now, here she was. Hikaru, determined to reclaim his father, became the entity known as Ginseigou. She eliminated her mother, challenged the world itself and decided to become a god.</em></p>
<p><em>What should I make of this…?</em></p>
<p><em>What am I supposed to do…?</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: I…</p>
<p>He wakes up in a room.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou86.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428" title="maou86" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou86.jpg" width="584" height="341"></a></p>
<p><em>What is this place? And how did I get here?</em></p>
<p>????: Mornin’.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Good morning. And you are…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/chachamaru-full-image.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1445" title="chachamaru full image" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/chachamaru-full-image.png" width="584" height="582"></a>Cha: You don’t remember?</p>
<p>Kageaki: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p>Cha: Even though we’re sharing the same bed, gazing into each other’s eyes like we’re about to kiss?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p><em>That’s right. I was swallowed up by that dark void and lost consciousness. There was no way I could have survived that…</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: I remember what I was doing right before I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Cha: But it doesn’t have much to do with this place, hence your confusion.</p>
<p>Ka: Yes.</p>
<p>Cha: Well, I suppose that can’t be helped. I was the one who brought you and Muramasa here, though.</p>
<p>Ka: Which means… that you were also at Hachimangu?</p>
<p>So eventually he remembers who Chachamaru is.</p>
<p>Cha: Yup.</p>
<p>He looks towards the corner, where the red spider is busy recovering from her wounds.</p>
<p>Cha: Worried about your Tsurugi?</p>
<p>Ka: She’s my partner, after all.</p>
<p>They engage in some small talk, and then:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou87.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1429" title="maou87" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou87.jpg" width="584" height="340"></a></p>
<p>Kageaki: If it is alright with you, I’d like to ask the question that have been on my mind for a while now.</p>
<p>Cha: Okay~</p>
<p><em>It was time to thoroughly discuss this.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: Is the Ginseigou here right now?</p>
<p>Cha: Nope!</p>
<p><em>And with that single word, the discussion was over.</em></p>
<p>Chachamaru tells Kageaki that the demise of Moriuji has already been found out, although it seems like his body hasn’t been found. (Kageaki concludes that it must’ve been swallowed by the black hole)</p>
<p>Kageaki: Your Excellency.</p>
<p>Cha: Aw, no need for such formalities! It’s not like we’re strangers to each other!</p>
<p>Ka: Actually, we are.</p>
<p>Cha: Stone cold. T_T</p>
<p>Ka: I would like to inquire about the incident at Hachimangu. Why exactly did you decide to bring me all the way here?</p>
<p>Cha: Well, it’s not like I could just leave you there. You would’ve been charged with murder and executed, you know!</p>
<p><em>For a crime I didn’t even commit.</em></p>
<p>Ka: And what exactly do you plan to do with me now?</p>
<p>Cha: You can decide that for yourself.</p>
<p>Ka: Are you letting me do as I wish, then…?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou88.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1430" title="maou88" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou88.jpg" width="584" height="338"></a></p>
<p>Cha: ‘Course I am! I’m not the type of girl who ties men up in basements and eats them for breakfast! No way! Oh, I’m rather the type who merely serves them from the shadows, without ever getting in their way. A virgin, of course. And yet, amazing in the sack. How unbelievably convenient is that?</p>
<p><em>I was not sure what to make of Ashikaga Chachamaru. Was she an enemy? Or an ally? I was filled with doubt. However, I do know for certain that she came to the defense of the Ginseigou.</em></p>
<p><em>Just what exactly is she planning? What is she after?</em></p>
<p><em>A seemingly endless web of mysteries surrounded her.</em></p>
<p>Cha: Ah, I didn’t think she’d show up this early. Must be because of you.</p>
<p>Ka: ……?</p>
<p>Cha: Look, it’s the very gal you’ve been searching for. Aren’t you glad you two could meet under less, um, heated circumstances?</p>
<p>Kageaki: ………</p>
<p><em>The person in question was none other than Hikaru, standing right in front of me.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou89.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1431" title="maou89" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou89.jpg" width="584" height="342"></a></p>
<p>Kageak: Hikaru…!!</p>
<p>And he immediately lunges at her, only to be knocked on his ass.</p>
<p>Hikaru: TCO, Kageaki! TCO!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Total cost of ownership…?</p>
<p>Cha: Didn’t you mean… TPO?</p>
<p>Hikaru: Ah, right. Well then, TPO. Time = Early morning, and I just woke up. Place = The veranda. Show some manners. In other words… good morning, Kageaki.</p>
<p>Kageaki: …..good morning.</p>
<p><em>She smiled as she uttered the familiar phrase, her gaze the exact same as it was two years ago. As if nothing had happened between us since then. Did the past two years mean nothing to her? That would be madness. It would only confirm her insanity. That is what I believed. Or rather, that is what I wanted to believe. It would make opposing her that much easier.</em></p>
<p><em>However, supposing that she was as sane as she had claimed…</em></p>
<p><em>…what then?</em></p>
<p><em>If everything she’s done up till now – all that destruction, all those murders – have been done out of her own free will, with a crystal clear conscience…?</em></p>
<p><em>If such was the case…</em></p>
<p><em>…then what was *I* supposed to do?</em></p>
<p>Kageaki then asks Chachamaru why she allows Hikaru to stay at this place.</p>
<p>Cha: She saved my life, you know.</p>
<p>Hikaru: Hmm… ah, I remember now! You were indeed on the verge of death, as I recall. I was wondering what sort of strange creature you were, since you weren’t reacting to my mental contamination. So I stopped my massacre then and there to investigate further.</p>
<p>Cha: Wait a sec, *that’s* why you saved me?!</p>
<p>Cha: Well, nevermind. I knew something like that would be the case. It doesn’t change that fact that I owe my life to you!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Hmm. If I may ask you one more thing.</p>
<p>Cha: Yeah?</p>
<p>Kageaki: Surely you must have an ulterior motive for co-operating with Hikaru.</p>
<p>Cha: I do!</p>
<p>Hikaru: It seems like she does.</p>
<p>Kageaki: And what sort of motive would that be…?</p>
<p>Cha: Not telling you~!</p>
<p>Hikaru: Seems like she’s not ready to tell you yet.</p>
<p><em>I turned to Hikaru.</em></p>
<p>Kageaki: And you’re fine with this?</p>
<p>Hikaru: I am. Just as I have my own desires, others have theirs. And if their actions end up hindering mine, it’s only a matter of battling it out and seeing who comes out on top.</p>
<p><em>And yet, the issue was still bothering me. What in the world was Chachamaru planning? What does she gain by letting Hikaru spread uncontrolled violence across the land? My mind was blank, devoid of answers.</em></p>
<p>Hikaru then goes off to have breakfast.</p>
<p>Cha: So, whatcha gonna do? Still planning to go back to Kamakura?</p>
<p>The scene ends, and we cut to the evening, with Kageaki and Muramasa in their rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou91.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1433" title="maou91" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou91.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: I think it’s clear that there’s no way we can leave this place right now.</p>
<p>Kageaki: That’s right. We’ve finally managed to determine her location, after all. Defeating her is another matter, though…</p>
<p>They think back on the insane power of her black/purple void.</p>
<p>Kageaki: What do you think, Muramasa? Can an ordinary Musha wield such power?</p>
<p>Muramasa: Her power is beyond my wildest dreams, that’s for sure…</p>
<p>Kageaki: She’s always been talented, but this is too much, even for someone like her.</p>
<p>Muramasa: There must be another reason.</p>
<p>???: Like Bakusai?</p>
<p>Muramasa: I have no idea what that is.</p>
<p>(Same here.)</p>
<p>???: Then cabbage? (hakusai)</p>
<p>Muramasa: I’m getting quite irritated, you know.</p>
<p>Kageaki: Me too.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Well, don’t say such things, then…</p>
<p>Kageaki: But… it wasn’t me.</p>
<p>Muramasa: Wha-?</p>
<p>Chachamaru comes out of hiding and pinches (or does *something*) to Muramasa which results in this facial expression:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou92.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1434" title="maou92" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou92.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Muramasa: Ehh?!</p>
<p>Muramasa: Were you hiding there all this time?!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Calm down, Muramasa. She’s not here to hurt you. Although, I wouldn’t say she’s truly on our side, either.</p>
<p>Cha: Well said! Good evening!</p>
<p>Kageaki: Good evening to you, too.</p>
<p>Cha: Nice weather we’re having.</p>
<p>Kag: Indeed. The moon can clearly be seen in the evening sky.</p>
<p>Mur: H-hey! Don’t just start chatting her up like nothing happened! You’re making me look like a total scaredy cat!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou93.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1435" title="maou93" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou93.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Ah, I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Cha: Hmpf. My house, my rules! I can lurk about as I see fit!</p>
<p>Mur: What? You live here? Isn’t this the mansion of a commander?</p>
<p>Kag: Actually… she is none other than Ashikaga Chachamaru, Commander of the Shogunate’s armored troops.</p>
<p>Cha: Yup! You heard the man! Now, down on your knees, lowly commoner!</p>
<p>Mur: *super sarcasm mode activate* Oh, you don’t say! So you were a commander! Ahaha! Oh my!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou94.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1436" title="maou94" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou94.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Mur: *back to SRS face* Sounds like a sick joke to me.</p>
<p>Cha: Ugh… murderous intent detected.</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, those were merely my true and honest feelings. Got a problem with it?</p>
<p>Cha: If it was anyone else I’d let that slide. I wonder why the words of Miss Third-rate Scrap Metal are pissing me off so much…</p>
<p>Mur: Wh-wh-who’s third-rate?!</p>
<p>Cha: Just my honest opinion. Got a problem with it?</p>
<p>Mur: Oh my. You’re pretty eager to die, aren’t you.</p>
<p>Cha: Eh, what did ya just say? You wanna take this outside?</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa, please… calm down.</p>
<p>Mur: *to Kageaki* Rejected!</p>
<p>Cha: You refuse to obey your own master?! :O</p>
<p>Mur: It’s fine. He wouldn’t get mad at me for something as trifling as this… RIGHT?</p>
<p>Kag: Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>I replied immediately, conveying my true feelings. However, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t at least a little bit influenced by the unquenchable murderous fire that lit up in her eyes as she glanced in my direction.</em></p>
<p>Mur: See? We are connected by mutual trust. Jealous, aren’t you?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou95.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1437" title="maou95" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou95.jpg" width="584" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Kageaki, you shouldn’t listen to what this bad, bad lady has to say. I think what you really need is another partner, one who’s much, much more refined. Let’s just throw this oversized spider out with the trash, shall we? Now then, let me introduce you to this other Tsurugi…</p>
<p>Catfight ensues.</p>
<p>Mur: C’mere you little runt!</p>
<p>Cha: Sure thing! Let’s see if spiders really taste like chicken…!</p>
<p>Kageaki: You two haven’t been able to get along from the very first moment you met. I wonder why that is.</p>
<p>Mur: Pure instinct is telling this girl is bad news! I can’t help it!</p>
<p>Cha: Indeed!</p>
<p>Kageaki: *to Chachamaru* Still, there is one thing I would like you to answer…</p>
<p>Cha: Listen, once I’m done here I’ll tell you everything from my measurements to my favorite position in bed, but for the love of god don’t interrupt now!</p>
<p>Kageaki: No, I have to. Just… how did you figure out that she was Muramasa?</p>
<p>The fighting stops.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. She could not have heard it from anyone, and yet, she instantly recognized this young Emishi woman as a Tsurugi.</em></p>
<p>Cha: I could smell her rusting steel from a mile away.</p>
<p>Mur: H-hey!</p>
<p>Cha: Oh, and just look at how she makes the floorboards creak.</p>
<p>Mur: I don’t weigh that much!!</p>
<p>Cha: Also, she gives off a Tsurugi-like vibe.</p>
<p>Kag: …..?</p>
<p>Cha: Well, suffice to say, I just have a special sort of sixth sense for this kind of thing. In any case, I have my own questions to ask.</p>
<p>Kag: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Cha: What are you planning to do from now on?</p>
<p>Kag: I realize I have no right to ask such a thing… however, I would like to request that you let us stay here for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Cha: Sure thing! Go ahead, make yourselves at home!</p>
<p>Kag: I am in your debt.</p>
<p>Mur: Midou. I have a proposal. Why don’t we camp outside the manor grounds?</p>
<p>Kag: ………</p>
<p>Cha: If you wanna go that badly, you have my premission to go by yourself!</p>
<p>Mur: You think I would leave my master alone in the same room with someone like you?</p>
<p>Cha: You. Alone. Outside.</p>
<p>Mur: NO.</p>
<p>Cha: He’s staying right here with me!</p>
<p>Mur: No he isn’t! He’ll listen to me if I ask him nicely. … probably.</p>
<p>Kag: Muramasa, if this is truly something you want, then I will not object.</p>
<p><em>I personally would not mind camping outside. I’ve already gotten used to it during my years in military service. Right now our main objective is staying close to the Ginseigou. Staying inside or outside the mansion would make little to no difference in that regard.</em></p>
<p>Mur: See~?</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou97.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1439" title="maou97" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou97.jpg" width="584" height="326"></a></p>
<p>Cha: You’re spoiling her rotten! Her combat skills will get rusty at this rate.</p>
<p>Kag: I do not believe that to be the case. Spoiled or not, I have faith that Muramasa will do what needs to be done when the time comes. And that is more than enough for me.</p>
<p>Mur: *blushes*</p>
<p>Mur: It is as he says. And since there is no way he would ever betray me, I will continue to be in top shape. How do you like that, Little Miss Commander? This is what it means to be a true Musha – a union of Tsurugi and master. Trusting each other, mutually accepting each other. Our bond isn’t so weak that your petty words could threaten it. Got that?</p>
<p>Cha: Hmm~ There seems to be another smudge on that wall over there…</p>
<p>Mur: H-hey! Listen when people are talking to you! I just said something really important a second ago!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou98.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1440" title="maou98" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou98.jpg" width="584" height="325"></a></p>
<p>Cha: Bleh, whatever. You two were just flirting as far as I’m concerned. In any case, are you *seriously* planning to drag him outside? He’ll catch a cold.</p>
<p>Mur: …I wasn’t actually serious.</p>
<p>Cha: Right. Anyway, make yourselves at home. As you can see, this mansion’s pretty swell.</p>
<p>Mur: It is indeed. So how about you get out and stop bothering us.</p>
<p>Cha: You get out too! This is *his* room!</p>
<p>Mur: Oh, *he* doesn’t mind if we stay in the same room. *turns to Kageki with a smile* Ri~~ght…?</p>
<p>Kag: W-well…</p>
<p>Cha: Man and woman will not be sharing the same bedroom, not in my house! You’ll have your own room. Servant!</p>
<p>Servant comes in.</p>
<p>Servant: Did you summon me, my Lady?</p>
<p>Cha: See that chick over there? Show her to the storage shed.</p>
<p>Mur: WHAT?!</p>
<p>Cha: Don’t you worry. My servant here will take you to a nice and comfy room.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou96.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1438" title="maou96" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou96.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>Catfight, round two.</p>
<p>Kageaki: ……..</p>
<p>Servant: Would you like a cup of tea?</p>
<p>Kag: Yes, please.</p>
<p>Servant: Understood. Just a moment.</p>
<p>Muramasa soon falls to her knees and transforms back into spider form against her will. Seems like he overexerted herself and basically shut down automatically.</p>
<p>Cha: Don’t worry, she’ll be fine come morning. In any case…</p>
<p>Cha: Let’s go to bed.</p>
<p>Kag: If by “going to bed” you mean sleeping, then I’ll have to agree.</p>
<p>Cha: Yup. *she makes herself comfortable on top of Kageaki*</p>
<p>Kag: If you would please return to your own chambers…</p>
<p>Cha: Nope. I’m gonna sleep here.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou99.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1441" title="maou99" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou99.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kag: Didn’t you say just a few minutes ago that men and women sharing the same room was strictly forbidden?</p>
<p>Cha: Ahaha, I remember no such thing~ Not at all~</p>
<p>Kag: This… could get out of hand.</p>
<p>Cha: I can actually fall sleep like this.</p>
<p>Kag: …….?</p>
<p>Cha: By being near you, I mean. The sounds you give off are gentle, and don’t disturb my ears. Every other sound in the world becomes dim when I’m by your side. When I’m like this, I can only hear you.</p>
<p><em>What is she talking about…?</em></p>
<p>So anyway, she turns off the lights.</p>
<p>Kag: In any case, before something that shouldn’t happen actually happens… I would ask you to-</p>
<p>Cha: I’ll be collecting rent, you know.</p>
<p>Kag: Rent…?</p>
<p>Cha: I’m not talking about money, naturally. Just… let me be at your side. Like this.</p>
<p>She then turns the lights off and asks Kageaki to tell him some story.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou100.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1380" title="maou100" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou100.jpg" width="584" height="327"></a></p>
<p>Kag: A story…?</p>
<p>Cha: Anything will do.</p>
<p>Kag: I see. But… won’t that make it that much harder to fall asleep?</p>
<p>Cha: No. On the contrary. When I listen to your voice, all other sounds in my head fly far, far away.</p>
<p>Kag: I… see. In that case… This one time, when I was still in high school…</p>
<p>Cha: Thanks…</p>
<p>The scene ends, and we get… um, this:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou101.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1381" title="maou101" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou101.jpg" width="584" height="324"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122193634/http://gareblogs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/maou102.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1382" title="maou102" alt="" src="./Full Metal Daemon Muramasa – Plot summary_translation – Tyrant – Part 3 _ gareblogs_files/maou102.jpg" width="584" height="328"></a></p>
<p>It starts flickering, there’s also some static (like it was some TV channel), and then it finally disappears. The hell was that?</p>
<p>In any case, this update has gotten quite long, so I’ll end it here.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Chachamaru was really great this time around, and that troubled face of Muramasa was lol. The faces that apear at the talk window are so cute sometimes. </p>
<p>I’m so curious for what will happen in the future and what is Chachamaru objective. If I’m not mistaken there is a Chachamru route, what will you do about it garejei?</p>
<p>Thanks one more time for the summarys.</p>
